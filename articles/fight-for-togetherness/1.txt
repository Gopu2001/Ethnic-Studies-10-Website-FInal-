14:16:17 KAT NASOL:  Hi, everyone!  Hello, and
14:16:22 welcome to University of Justice and
14:16:25 Liberation.  And thank you so much for joining
14:16:27 us on a Wednesday afternoon.  As y'all know, we
14:16:30 always have a popping play list to start off
14:16:31 our classes.
14:16:35 So today is a really special class.
14:16:39 Unfortunately, Dr. Robyn Rodriguez, who is our
14:16:44 usual emcee for our course, is not here today.
14:16:47 But me, Kandi, and Greg are all here to help
14:16:51 out.  And so, just to make this course
14:16:55 accessible, let me just make sure that folks'
14:16:58 videos are on.
14:17:03 And yes, thanks, Greg, for the reminder to
14:17:06 record.  And we'll also be sharing our
14:17:08 recordings for folks who are unable to make it
14:17:13 today.  So as
14:17:21 let me also get that started, as well.
14:17:27 AUDIO:  This meeting is being reportedded.
14:17:30 KAT NASOL:  All et?  Okay.  Welcome,
14:17:30 everyone.
14:17:32 We wanted to start with a land
14:17:34 acknowledgment and acknowledge the land that we
14:17:38 are gathered upon.  Currently, this course is
14:17:40 based in the University of California Davis
14:17:43 Asian American Studies Department.  And so,
14:17:47 from the vantage point of UC Davis, for
14:17:52 thousands of years, this land belonged to the
14:17:56 Kutlen people.  There are three recognized
14:18:02 tribes.  (listing)   And the Patwin people have
14:18:04 remained committed to the stewardship of this
14:18:07 land over many centuries.  It has been
14:18:09 cherished and protected as elders have
14:18:11 instructed the young people throughout
14:18:13 generations.  So we are honored and grateful to
14:18:15 be here today on their traditional lands.
14:18:18 And for many of us that are arriving to
14:18:21 this land, we know that is not enough to just
14:18:23 acknowledge the land we are standing upon, but
14:18:28 also to move beyond that to coconspirators in
14:18:29 reclamation.
14:18:37 Additionally, many of us are aarrivants
14:18:39 who have been violently moved and displaced
14:18:43 from lands through colonization and empire.
14:18:46 And so our class today, of course, centers on
14:18:49 helping us sharpen our analysis in terms of
14:18:52 white supremacy, colonization, liberalization
14:18:55 and empire, and really reflecting on the land
14:18:58 from which we have arrived from and arrived to.
14:19:01 And so also we are gathered hoar today to
14:19:06 resist and build cross racial resistance and
14:19:08 solidarity, to up pend these structures of
14:19:11 violence and domination.  We also draw strength
14:19:15 from ancestors who have survived these very
14:19:17 structures we find ourselves living in today.
14:19:20 Hopefully, we are going to be energized by
14:19:23 this work we're doing together and working
14:19:26 towards an alternative future and world-making.
14:19:30 So to start off, we're going to go over
14:19:32 some Zoom etiquette and worldview.  So I'm
14:19:34 wondering if we can share our PowerPoint in
14:19:37 terms of some community guidelines that we can
14:19:38 follow for the day.
14:19:41 So can folks see the slides?
14:19:48 Awesome.  So, as folks are already doing
14:19:52 and sharing in the chat, feel free to send any
14:19:56 chat messages to the host, the panelists, and
14:19:59 our attendees.  Please raise your hand in the
14:20:01 webinar to indicate that you need something
14:20:04 from the host.  Many of our webinar hosts that
14:20:07 are with us today know how to attend to your
14:20:11 questions.  And then lastly, there is a Q&A
14:20:13 window allowing you to ask questions to the
14:20:16 host and the panelists as we go along today's
14:20:17 course.
14:20:20 And so, definitely feel free to engage
14:20:25 with us.  I know the webinar feature has
14:20:26 limitations in terms of making sure we're
14:20:28 building these connections.  But feel free to
14:20:31 use those Q&A features to really engage with us
14:20:32 throughout the day.
14:20:35 Can you go to the second slide?
14:20:38 Awesome.  Other Zoom etiquette, I know
14:20:41 that some folks have -- are really familiar
14:20:43 with Zoom.  Sometimes you have Zoom calls,
14:20:47 right, from like 10:00 a.m. to 5:00.  Other
14:20:50 folks are really new to this technology?  So
14:20:53 please be sure to mute yourselves, especially
14:20:55 so we can all hear the panelists that we're
14:20:56 going to be hearing from today.  If you have
14:20:59 any questions, please feel free to put them in
14:21:02 the chat.  Remember that this space is also a
14:21:05 safe and a brave space.  Everyone is here to
14:21:07 learn; everyone is coming from different
14:21:09 vantage points.  And so make sure that, you
14:21:11 know, we're all creating this safe space
14:21:15 together.  And lastly, respect is a really big
14:21:18 part of Zoom.  If you disagree, please do it
14:21:21 respectfully.  It's okay to disagree and
14:21:25 provide that productive tension?  But feel free
14:21:28 to also try on new ideas and different
14:21:29 viewpoints, as well.
14:21:32 And so, can we go to the next slide?
14:21:33 Great.
14:21:36 And so just a brief introduction to this
14:21:40 course.  So the University for Justice and
14:21:43 Liberation is a six-week intensive political
14:21:46 education program that offers organizers in
14:21:47 training from around the world an opportunity
14:21:50 to deepen their understanding, skills, and
14:21:55 networking to build cross-racial and
14:21:57 transformative solidarity.  Currently, we have
14:21:59 256 organizers around the world who have
14:22:01 committed to this course.  Which is so wild?
14:22:05 Like, we have folks from Australia to Canada.
14:22:08 And it's kind of mind blowing, right?
14:22:11 And so in addition to these public
14:22:14 lectures, we are also hosting skills trainings
14:22:18 with our organizers-in-training.  We're also
14:22:20 hosting breakout groups and critical
14:22:22 conversations with each other, just to build
14:22:25 this global network.  And really, this course
14:22:28 is a free and public and open course to even
14:22:30 who is interested in learning about these
14:22:33 issues of race and solidarity in a really
14:22:35 deeper way.
14:22:37 And so we're also going to be introducing
14:22:42 the folks who helped create this course.  So
14:22:52 that's the Bulosan Center, the People's
14:22:57 Collective for Justice and Liberation.  So,
14:22:59 Greg, would you share a little bit more about
14:23:05 the peoples Collective about what they've been
14:23:08 doing?
14:23:09 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Hello, everybody.  Real
14:23:24 quick, if you can give me host rights, Kat?  So
14:23:25 Form 470 due 9/24, is for not spending $2k in 2020 (and not having an open committee)-	“the calendar year” means in 2020, yes?-	To check, not an exception of salary less than $200/month, yes?
14:23:31 -- so I can spotlight our ASL
14:23:31 interpreters.
14:23:36 We have Cory as our captioner.
14:23:38 We have our accessibility coordinator with
14:23:43 us.  To lift them up.  Why is this so hard?
14:23:45 Let me make sure -- do I have the spot lights?
14:23:49 There we go!  Are you seeing...?
14:23:53 Okay.  Is the spotlight working?
14:24:00 Okay, great.  Thank you so much, Bee.
14:24:01 (Laughing)
14:24:04 All right.  So I wanted to lift up our S
14:24:06 Al coordinators.  It's really important.  Just
14:24:08 a really quick reminder if we can also pace
14:24:12 ourselves, as we have speakers that will be
14:24:14 joining with us for our ASL interpreters as
14:24:17 well as our captioners.
14:24:21 My name is Kandi, pronouns she/her/hers.
14:24:23 I have Greg who is also joining us, and he'll
14:24:27 introduce himself.  But we cofounded the
14:24:31 People's collective.  We formed for Justice and
14:24:34 Liberation, which started at the start of the
14:24:39 pandemic, across the globe to be a part of a
14:24:41 movement addressing anti-Asian racism and build
14:24:44 solidarity with other communities of color.  We
14:24:47 organize with a multigenerational, cross-sector
14:24:48 framework.
14:24:51 And through that, we gathered this
14:24:56 extensive work, working with Dr. Robyn
14:25:00 Rodriguez and Kat to form the University for
14:25:02 Justice and Liberation, which is a six-week
14:25:05 intensive program that offers organizers in
14:25:07 training from around the world an opportunity
14:25:11 to deepen their skills and form networks to
14:25:14 build cross-racial solidarity.  We have over
14:25:19 256, like, 300-plus coordinators in training
14:25:22 who have committed to UJL.  In addition to
14:25:24 lectures and workshops for those committed, we
14:25:26 will host dynamic webinars and critical
14:25:29 conversations open to the broader public to
14:25:31 ground participants in the history of
14:25:33 organizing by people of color and serve as a
14:25:36 bridge to current campaigns, thought leaders,
14:25:39 and organizations advancing justice and
14:25:40 liberation for all people.
14:25:45 So everyone, welcome to the University for
14:25:47 Justice and Liberation.  We're grateful for
14:25:50 y'all here for joining us.  I'm not sure if
14:25:53 Greg would like to chime in a little bit?
14:25:54 GREG CENDANA:  Thank you, Kandi, and good
14:25:58 afternoon, everyone.  Gregory Cendana.  Most
14:26:03 folks call me Greg.  My pronouns are he/him/his
14:26:09 or shiy.  For those not familiar, that last is
14:26:12 a gender-neutral pronoun in Tagalog, which is a
14:26:13 language of the Philippines.
14:26:16 The only thing I would add is our goal
14:26:21 through this UJL experiment is to think about
14:26:25 how we are recognizing Ethnic Studies and the
14:26:28 relationship we have as communities to academia
14:26:30 and academic institutions.  I think one thing
14:26:32 that's really exciting about this partnership
14:26:34 is that we are grounding it in the experiences
14:26:38 of folks on the ground in organizing.  We have
14:26:40 an advisory committee of folks who are from
14:26:42 academic institutions and from community-based
14:26:48 organizations.  And are being mindful of the
14:26:50 particular ways in which having a virtual
14:26:53 platform will allow us to kind of reach people
14:26:56 and engage with people across time zones,
14:26:59 across states, around the world.  I know that
14:27:02 we have folks who are UJL participants coming
14:27:07 from Canada and Australia and what not, as
14:27:09 well.  And so I'm really excited about the
14:27:11 opportunity to build with folks, to learn with
14:27:13 folks, to grow with folks, to be challenged
14:27:17 with folks.  And really welcome that curiosity
14:27:21 and that, that openness, and that energy as we
14:27:24 go through the next six weeks together.
14:27:27 And then the Tuesdays are open, in
14:27:31 particular, in that -- these are the open
14:27:33 public lectures, and folks even outside of the
14:27:37 UC Davis or the UJL students are also invited
14:27:39 to participate.
14:27:43 Awesome.  So I'm going to now pass it to
14:27:45 Kat, who will tell us a little bit more about
14:27:49 the topic for this week.
14:27:52 KAT NASOL:  Hi, everyone.  Can people hear
14:27:53 me?
14:27:57 Okay.  I'm gonna assume yes.
14:28:01 Hi, everyone.  Also, I realize that I also
14:28:04 failed to introduce myself.  So.  My name is
14:28:08 Kat Nasol.  I am a Ph.D. student here at UC
14:28:12 Davis.  And I'm based in the UC Davis Cultural
14:28:15 Studies Department.  And I'm also a part of the
14:28:22 Bulosan Center for Filipino Studies, Filipinx
14:28:27 Studies.  We are named after a writer,
14:28:30 educator, and activist.  And the Bulosan Center
14:28:34 really grew out of a grassroots effort of
14:28:36 really creating some sort of space that really
14:28:39 shares our stories from our communities.  And
14:28:41 for a really long time, Dr. Rodriguez, who was
14:28:44 the founder of the Center, has been really
14:28:48 pushing for a Center like this to happen.  And,
14:28:51 you know, we were met with a lot of challenges
14:28:54 in terms of academia and academic institutions
14:28:56 not really seeing our community's stories as
14:28:58 valid to fund.
14:29:04 And so the Center was really created and
14:29:09 fundraised by our own community, by our lollas,
14:29:12 by our grandmothers, by our aunties and uncles
14:29:15 who also believed in this vision.  And here we
14:29:18 are two years after our founding.  And we're
14:29:22 now a community-based education and engagement
14:29:25 center at the UC Davis Asian American Studies
14:29:27 Department.  That was all through grassroots
14:29:30 work.  And even with our partnership, the Asian
14:29:33 American Studies Department at UC Davis, that
14:29:35 department was also created through student
14:29:38 activism and the efforts of student activists
14:29:43 who saw the Ethnic Studies struggles and the
14:29:46 strike in 1968 like by the Third World
14:29:49 Liberation Front.  And a lot of students at UC
14:29:52 Davis felt there needed to be an Ethnic Studies
14:29:54 Department at our campus.
14:29:57 And so both our Center and the Department
14:29:59 in which we are housed come from this long line
14:30:00 of struggle.
14:30:02 So that sort of relates to our topic
14:30:05 today.  So today's webinar is entitled race,
14:30:08 struggle, and solidarity in a time of a global
14:30:11 pandemic.  And it is the first of six webinars
14:30:14 that we will host every Tuesday.  So today's
14:30:16 webinar examines the historical context of race
14:30:19 and racism to better understand and frame the
14:30:22 current rise of racism and xenophobia in this
14:30:24 moment of the coronavirus pandemic.
14:30:27 To do this, we're going to examine Asian
14:30:30 immigration and migration historically; the
14:30:34 ways in which anti-Asian racism, white settler
14:30:38 racial capitalist labor demands, and U.S.
14:30:40 imperialism have shaped Asian immigration and
14:30:42 migration over time.  We'll also examine the
14:30:45 context that shapes the Asian American
14:30:48 community; formations that dominate in the
14:30:51 United States today, including the brain drain
14:30:52 and the model minority myth.
14:30:55 And throughout today, we'll draw
14:30:57 connections of solidarity between Black,
14:31:01 Indigenous, and Brown communities and people of
14:31:04 color overall, and share our different yet
14:31:05 shared experiences with white supremacy.
14:31:09 So I'm gonna pass it back to Kandi and
14:31:12 Greg to introduce our speakers.
14:31:22 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Hello.  I believe we are
14:31:24 changing our interpreters.  Just one second.
14:31:30 Make sure we spotlight.  Hi, Stephanie!
14:31:34 So, now I'd like to introduce Soya, who
14:31:36 has been active in the progressive movement for
14:31:40 the last 25 years.  During the 1990s, she
14:31:43 worked as a reporter at the International
14:31:47 Examiner Communications and Policies Staff for
14:31:51 the Washington State House Democratic Caucus,
14:31:55 and Executive Director of the Washington
14:31:59 Alliance for Immigrant and Refugee Justice.
14:32:02 She founded the Asian American Pacific Islander
14:32:05 Commission, which formed in 1996 to restore
14:32:07 food and cash assistance for low-income
14:32:10 immigrants and refugees in Washington State.
14:32:13 During the 2000s, she worked at the Social
14:32:16 Justice Fund, a public foundation supporting
14:32:20 progressive organizations in the northwest, and
14:32:23 consulted for various institutions like the
14:32:33 Western State Center, the philanthropic fund it
14:32:36 are racial equity, and the Washington State
14:32:38 budget and policy center.
14:32:43 At ChangeLab, Soya has offered two
14:32:46 research reports:  Left or right of the color
14:32:50 line?  Asian Americans and the racial justice
14:32:53 movement.  And the importance of Asian
14:32:55 Americans:  It's not what you think.  And
14:32:57 coauthored the Asian American racial justice
14:33:01 toolkit.  She has convened numerous public
14:33:04 events, uniting scholars with social movement
14:33:11 activists to explore race, gender, war, empire,
14:33:15 and Asian American identity.  Her writing has
14:33:19 been published in Othering and Belonging:
14:33:23 Expanding the circle of human concern, and
14:33:30 cited in places like the Ruttledge companion to
14:33:33 Asian American media, Colorlines, and the
14:33:34 Guardian.
14:33:36 Thank you so much, Soya, for joining us.
14:33:37 We're excited to have you here.
14:33:42 Oh, we gotta give you all the love, Soya!
14:33:44 All the love.  (Laughing)
14:33:49 SOYA JUNG:  Thank you!  So much!  Can
14:33:52 everybody hear me?
14:34:00 Great.  So, I am wondering...   (audio
14:34:00 garbling)
14:34:07 If I can screen share -- is that...?
14:34:20 Can you see me now?  (Laughing)
14:34:22 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Yes, we can see you.  I
14:34:29 can see you.  There you go.
14:34:32 SOYA JUNG:  Okay.  I'm gonna try to screen
14:34:38 share.  I think that -- um.  Robyn had asked me
14:34:40 if I could put some slides together.  I don't
14:34:43 think they're completely necessary.  So I'll
14:34:47 just talk.  Is that okay?
14:34:53 Okay.  Great.  So thank you for that warm
14:34:59 and kind introduction, Kandi.  I was asked to,
14:35:02 as Kandi mentioned, place what we're
14:35:05 experiencing now into some historical context.
14:35:09 So one of the things that we have done at
14:35:14 ChangeLab is create something called A
14:35:17 Different Asian American Timeline.  And I will
14:35:24 put the...   link in the chat.
14:35:31 So, the reason that we did this is we
14:35:34 found that oftentimes when you look at Asian
14:35:37 American historical timelines, they include
14:35:40 things that happened to Asians in the Americas
14:35:43 but...   those specific events don't
14:35:46 necessarily tell you what was happening in the
14:35:52 world around them.  And how those experiences
14:35:55 related to experiences of other groups of
14:35:56 people during the same time.
14:36:00 So we created this timeline that starts in
14:36:05 1441 and ends in 2017, 'cause I got tired in
14:36:08 2017.  (Laughs)  But!  It's about 600 years of
14:36:12 history.  And it really organizes history in
14:36:14 terms of periods of crisis.
14:36:18 So I'm gonna sort of dive into what I
14:36:21 think are some of the key periods of crisis and
14:36:25 ways that we can think of ourselves as Asian
14:36:27 Americans and how we've been racialized in
14:36:30 relationship to other groups of people.
14:36:33 So one of the first premises of the
14:36:36 timeline is that there is no separate history.
14:36:38 Right?  There are group differentiated
14:36:41 experiences, but the boundaries of those groups
14:36:43 change, and also the groups themselves are in
14:36:46 close relationship with one another within the
14:36:48 economy and in politics.
14:36:53 So in every period, systems and
14:36:56 institutions shape culture, politics, and forms
14:37:00 of resistance...   and vice versa!  So systems
14:37:02 and institutions change as culture and politics
14:37:03 change.
14:37:05 So I'm not gonna go through six centuries
14:37:08 of history.  'Cause, you can do that on your
14:37:13 own.  But I would encourage all of us to think
14:37:16 about moments and periods of crisis.  Crises
14:37:18 are opportunities to make new meaning by
14:37:21 telling a story that explains the crisis.  And
14:37:25 in every crisis, forces on all sides,
14:37:28 ideologically, politically, are competing to do
14:37:31 that.  So things like war, economic upheaval,
14:37:36 et cetera, a pandemic, are moments when life
14:37:37 abruptly changes and people construct new
14:37:40 identities, make new demands, see themselves
14:37:42 and the world around them differently.  But it
14:37:44 also takes more than opinions and beliefs to
14:37:48 change systems.  It takes power, which requires
14:37:51 organizing and political strategy.
14:37:55 So starting in the period of colonization
14:37:58 of the Americas, one of the things that I
14:38:01 wanted to say is we sometimes tell this story
14:38:06 in kind of a simple way, right?  Whites, as
14:38:10 sort of villains and racists, centralizing
14:38:15 slavery as a system of anti-Blackness, seeing
14:38:18 Indigenous land theft as genocide.  Certainly,
14:38:21 these are true outcomes of this period.  But!
14:38:24 There's another question:  What goals lay
14:38:27 underneath these projects of slavery and
14:38:28 Indigenous genocide?
14:38:31 For example, if white people hated Black
14:38:35 people so much, why did they go to such effort
14:38:38 to transport, forcibly, 12 million Black people
14:38:39 to the Americas?
14:38:43 So asking ourselves these questions gets
14:38:47 us to think critically about what was going on?
14:38:49 Whose interests were these, the people in power
14:38:52 acting in?  And so it helps us to sort of
14:38:53 change the narrative.
14:38:54 And I would say that throughout U.S.
14:38:58 history, the central racial narrative has been
14:39:01 that in order for some people to prosper,
14:39:05 others must necessarily suffer.  And that has
14:39:07 created suffering for various groups of people
14:39:09 across the board.
14:39:12 So, we need to show that this kind of
14:39:16 thinking is a way for people in power to create
14:39:19 policies, laws, systems that hurt all of
14:39:20 society.
14:39:23 So in the 16th and 17th century, one of
14:39:25 the things that I wanted to say is that Europe
14:39:29 was going through periods of massive
14:39:32 devastating war.  You know, in the case of
14:39:35 Germany, wiped out a third of its population.
14:39:38 Monarchies were running out of money.  They
14:39:41 needed to find a way to remake their fortunes
14:39:43 abroad, outside of Europe.  And so in doing so,
14:39:47 they used tried and true ways of social
14:39:50 control, like racialization.  This is not
14:39:53 something that was...   wholly invented in the
14:39:56 United States.  Europeans were racializing and
14:40:00 colonizing other Europeans.  The Irish, Slaves,
14:40:03 Romas, Jews.  They were also using things like
14:40:08 enclosure to take what had been publicly-held
14:40:09 lands and privatizing them.
14:40:11 So these are some sort of racial
14:40:12 technologies that they brought from Europe to
14:40:14 the United States.
14:40:18 Also!  British colonial leaders, remember,
14:40:21 they were a small number of people in Jamestown
14:40:24 Virginia, for example.  They needed to
14:40:27 cultivate a segment of the population under
14:40:30 their control to settle land, to flank them in
14:40:34 battles against Indigenous peoples who were
14:40:37 defending their territory, and in potential
14:40:40 uprisings by enslaved Africans.  That's how we
14:40:42 get the construction of whiteness!
14:40:44 So when we talk about -- I'm going to use
14:40:46 the term "racial capitalism."  When we talk
14:40:49 about race and racial capitalism, racial
14:40:56 capitalism is just capitalism.  It just points
14:40:58 out that capitalism needs race to function,
14:41:01 right?  And that race is more of a verb than a
14:41:05 noun.  We shouldn't think about race as groups
14:41:06 of people; we should think about it as a
14:41:08 political system and a set of relationships.
14:41:11 And we often think that we, as people of color,
14:41:14 are the main targets of racial capitalism.  But
14:41:16 for those in power, the most important work
14:41:18 that white supremacy and racial capitalism does
14:41:21 is to animate political thought and action
14:41:24 among people who are raised as white.  Capital
14:41:26 and the state produce and reproduce race as a
14:41:28 form of social control by creating and
14:41:31 capturing a segment of the working class who
14:41:33 are considered to be white, with the white male
14:41:36 as the rights-bearing deserving human.
14:41:42 So, just to say that in 1607, 15,000
14:41:46 indentured servants begin arriving in Virginia
14:41:50 from Europe.  And some are sold as property.
14:41:53 Many of them die of disease, maiming, even
14:41:56 murder.  And then in 1620, they go back to
14:41:59 England, the colonial elites, and bring more
14:42:02 indentured servants from England to work in
14:42:05 very intensive labor -- sorry, labor-intensive
14:42:06 crops.
14:42:10 So for the next hundred years, one-half to
14:42:15 two-thirds of all European immigrants to the
14:42:17 American colonies are indentured certify
14:42:22 servants.
14:42:24 Now, it's important to also say that
14:42:28 enslaved Africans into the Americas as
14:42:30 property...   their status started to shift
14:42:32 really around the end of the 17th century.
14:42:37 Because there was an uprising...   There was an
14:42:42 uprising called Bacon's Rebellion in Jamestown
14:42:46 Colony that united indentured Europeans and
14:42:49 enslaved Africans together against the colonial
14:42:52 ruling class.  The ruling class started to see
14:42:56 this as a problem!  They needed a way to
14:42:59 control these kinds of uprisings.  So they
14:43:03 started to pass things called Slave Codes,
14:43:06 which basically made enslaved Africans slaves
14:43:09 for life, permanently, and passed down through
14:43:11 the status of their mothers.
14:43:14 So, that starts to create a distance
14:43:17 between indentured European servants who, at
14:43:20 the end of their contracts, could get maybe a
14:43:23 piece of land, a gun, some seeds, et cetera,
14:43:27 versus enslaved Africans who were now enslaved
14:43:27 for life.
14:43:29 So it's important to sort of see the roots
14:43:33 of this, because it really is a divide and
14:43:35 conquer tactic.  And you start to see the roots
14:43:39 of what we see even today, about white people
14:43:43 seeing their interests...   Let me rephrase
14:43:46 that.  White nationalists!  Framing their
14:43:49 interests as hoarding the power of the state,
14:43:53 political power, national belonging, for whites
14:43:57 only.  Because they see themselves as the
14:44:00 underdog!  As being actually oppressed by a
14:44:03 state that is trying to fight for a multiracial
14:44:05 democracy, for inclusion, et cetera, that
14:44:07 threatens their status.
14:44:11 So, I'm gonna just fast forward to the
14:44:15 Civil War.  One thing to just say about this,
14:44:19 again, in terms of what does Asian American
14:44:23 history have to do with Indigenous genocide and
14:44:26 slavery.  You start to look at history, in the
14:44:28 timeline that we've constructed, and see
14:44:30 multiple things happening at the same time.
14:44:34 That we sometimes look at separately.  So at
14:44:36 the same time that the Civil War is happening,
14:44:40 the United States is also forcibly removing
14:44:42 Indigenous people from their lands.  They're
14:44:46 also bringing in indentured workers from China
14:44:49 and other places in Asia.
14:44:54 So...   One of the things that happens
14:44:58 after the Civil War is that the -- there's a
14:45:01 huge national debate and conversation over the
14:45:06 status of the quote-unquote "Coolie,"
14:45:09 specifically indentured Chinese labor.  At a
14:45:11 time when you're seeing, now, suddenly millions
14:45:14 of free Black workers in the economy, what is
14:45:18 the status of the Coolie?  Some people felt
14:45:21 like Chinese indentured labor should remain
14:45:23 excluded from inclusion in the United States as
14:45:25 citizens with rights, because they needed an
14:45:29 exploitable labor force.
14:45:33 Oh!  I'm going to pause.  I see.  Sorry,
14:45:36 Kandi.
14:45:37 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Sorry about that.  Thank
14:45:42 you.  We're just switching our transitions.
14:45:44 SOYA JUNG:  Sure.
14:45:47 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Okay, you're good to go.
14:45:49 Thank you, Soya.
14:45:51 SOYA JUNG:  Okay.  You're welcome, sorry.
14:45:53 I didn't quite get that message completely.
14:45:53 Okay.
14:45:57 So it's important to see these processes
14:45:59 as very much linked.  The United States was
14:46:03 fighting a Civil War, which was over slavery,
14:46:08 but also over a system, an economic system that
14:46:11 had been global in scale...   (audio slowing)
14:46:16 It was a massive shift from moving from the
14:46:19 institution of slavery to an institution in
14:46:22 which those workers would be -- with
14:46:26 reconstruction, where federal troops oversaw
14:46:29 the reconstruction amendments, basically making
14:46:32 sure that free Black workers and
14:46:37 newly-emancipated...   newly-emancipated
14:46:40 formerly enslaved people were integrated into
14:46:40 society.
14:46:44 That was then stopped by things like
14:46:48 terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan,
14:46:52 as well as political -- a political deal that
14:46:56 basically ended Reconstruction and instituted a
14:47:00 system of Jim Crow segregation that would last
14:47:01 until the middle of the 20th century.
14:47:02 But at the same time that this is
14:47:08 happening, you have the Dawes Act.  You have
14:47:11 the Curtis Act, which essentially results in
14:47:14 the loss of control of 90 million acres of
14:47:17 Indigenous landed to the United States, and the
14:47:20 forcible removal of the Choctaw, chick saw,
14:47:25 Cherokee, Seminole, and other tribes.
14:47:30 So at the same time, as well, you have the
14:47:37 Spanish-american war, which ends up an ex-ing
14:47:41 Guam and others, securing the United States as
14:47:46 a power and law firming an era of U.S.
14:47:47 imperialism that continues today.
14:47:51 Again, of the U.S. generals in the
14:47:54 Philippines, 26 had been officers in the
14:47:59 quote-unquote Indian Wars.  One of the officers
14:48:03 had been in charge of removing the Sioux to
14:48:07 reservations during the 70s and was in command
14:48:08 during the Wounded Knee massacre.
14:48:11 So these are some of the ways we can look
14:48:14 at history and see how we are -- even if we are
14:48:18 differentially experiencing racial capitalism,
14:48:20 we are very much related within that system.
14:48:24 So, I'm going to not go through the
14:48:27 entirety of history, because we don't have
14:48:30 enough time.  But another thing to think about
14:48:34 is the question of migration.  When Robyn was
14:48:38 talking to me about this class, she wanted me
14:48:43 to sort of frame Asian migration, immigration,
14:48:46 in the context of racial capitalism.  We can
14:48:49 also think about internal migration, right?
14:48:52 This Civil War which basically created sort of
14:48:58 an internal refugee population of upwards of a
14:48:59 million African-Americans.  Or the ways in
14:49:01 which Indigenous people have been forcibly
14:49:05 removed from their home territories to
14:49:07 different parts of the country.
14:49:11 So, migration, I think, I would just ask
14:49:14 us to...   think about it in ways in which we
14:49:18 can see each other in the story of American
14:49:26 history.  Including!  The migration of
14:49:27 indentured European migrants, who were escaping
14:49:30 an incredibly oppressive feudal system in
14:49:32 Europe...   to be promised land and freedom in
14:49:35 the United States.  That was a remarkable form
14:49:40 of upward mobility that they could never have
14:49:42 imagined in feudal Europe.
14:49:44 So all of these things are ways that we
14:49:46 can think about ourselves as being related.
14:49:49 I'm...   going to also just say something
14:49:55 on the question of U.S. foreign policy.  If you
14:49:59 look at 1953, for example -- or the period
14:50:04 around World War II.  So, World War II was
14:50:08 really about fighting fascism.  Yes?  The
14:50:11 United States entered the world war pretty
14:50:17 late.  It also rejected 20,000 Jewish refugee
14:50:19 children.  But!  It came out of the war
14:50:23 positioning itself as a hero and saving the
14:50:28 world from fascism.  And...   When this
14:50:31 happens, it starts to face intense criticism
14:50:36 from the Soviet Union, from China, during the
14:50:41 Cold War over its embedded racism.  So, Black
14:50:44 GIs, for example, returned from World War II
14:50:47 fighting fascism to face Jim Crow and
14:50:48 segregation.
14:50:51 So one of the responses to that was what
14:50:54 we now think of as the model minority myth.
14:50:58 The model minority myth often gets talked about
14:51:02 in terms of its...   inaccuracy?  Not all Asian
14:51:04 Americans are successful and smart and good at
14:51:08 math, et cetera.  It often gets talked about in
14:51:10 terms of its inherent anti-Blackness.  If
14:51:13 there's a model minority, there must be a
14:51:15 problem minority.  But the thing that often
14:51:18 doesn't get talked about is the model minority
14:51:21 myth in the context of U.S. empire.  It really
14:51:24 was in service to the United States positioning
14:51:29 itself globally against Communism and as a free
14:51:31 and democratic society.
14:51:35 So, I won't get too much into the
14:51:37 construction of the myth.  I think you can do
14:51:40 that through the timeline.  I would also
14:51:44 suggest a great book by Ellen Wu called it
14:51:49 happen can the color of Success that really,
14:51:51 really pulls apart the construction of that
14:51:58 myth.  The Color of Success.  But again, when
14:52:04 Dr. King delivered his Vietnam speech in 1967,
14:52:07 he really called out U.S. imperialism as well
14:52:11 as racism.  I and others believe this is really
14:52:14 what got him killed and losing support,
14:52:17 particularly from mainstream liberal whites, as
14:52:19 well as Black people.  But I think we need to
14:52:21 challenge ourselves -- and this is where Asian
14:52:23 American experiences and history becomes
14:52:26 important -- to insert a critique of U.S.
14:52:29 militarism and war and empire into the racial
14:52:31 justice movement.
14:52:36 So, right now we are facing heightened
14:52:41 anti-Asian racism in an era of Trump and COVID.
14:52:43 I...   again, invite us to think about this as
14:52:47 a moment of crisis.  To ask ourselves what led
14:52:50 to this crisis?  What economic policies, social
14:52:54 policies, social movements brought us to this
14:52:57 point?  And in this moment, we should place the
14:53:02 blame for the COVID crisis and for the surge in
14:53:06 anti-Asian racist violence squarely on Trump
14:53:08 and his allies.  But in the same breath, we
14:53:13 should also be saying:  Anti-Asian racism is
14:53:16 nothing new.  Trump and his allies are just
14:53:18 pulling it out of the recycling bin of history,
14:53:24 re-purposing it for their own agenda, and
14:53:27 creating, basically jet fueling, this surge in
14:53:30 anti-Asian hatred while doing nothing for the
14:53:33 everyday people and families who are suffering
14:53:35 with the COVID crisis.
14:53:40 I think we should also say:  Trump, as we
14:53:46 know, is an Islamphobe and an anti-semite.
14:53:49 He's beholden to a Christian evangelical base,
14:53:53 as well as to anti-semites and violent racists.
14:53:55 One of his first moves was the Muslim ban.  And
14:53:58 yet on China, he's now denouncing the
14:54:02 oppression of China's Muslim population, at
14:54:06 least one million of whom are being detained by
14:54:08 the Chinese government in reeducation camps.
14:54:11 Why is Trump denouncing these very real human
14:54:14 rights violations and attacking China, when he
14:54:17 has embraced people like Israel's prime
14:54:20 minister, the prime minister of India, and
14:54:22 other authoritarians?  Certainly it's not out
14:54:25 of love for Muslims.
14:54:28 So the short answer is racial politics and
14:54:30 reelection.  Trump's numbers are not looking
14:54:34 good.  Meanwhile, U.S. opinions of China, which
14:54:36 have never been good, have almost always been
14:54:40 negative, but have been rising against China
14:54:44 since 2017.  By some reports, are at an
14:54:46 all-time high across political parties.  There
14:54:49 are lots of reasons for this, not the least of
14:54:53 which is the anti-China racism of the Obama era
14:54:55 Tea Parties, but combined with the fact that
14:54:58 Trump's closed campaign advisors include people
14:55:01 who view China as a major political and
14:55:04 economic threat, attacking China has now become
14:55:06 a central feature of Republican campaign
14:55:08 strategy.  And it's also, mm, at times being
14:55:12 used by some Democrats.  Biden was certainly
14:55:16 jumping on the anti-China bandwagon.  Our
14:55:18 people kicked him in the butt over that, so
14:55:20 he's backed off a little bit.
14:55:22 So Trump's rhetoric, echoed by other
14:55:26 Republican candidates, creates a climate in
14:55:30 which anti-Asian violence can proliferate.
14:55:32 That climate is made possible by the long, long
14:55:34 history of anti-Asian racism.
14:55:38 I think that in this moment, our challenge
14:55:41 is to both denounce very clearly anti-Asian
14:55:44 racism as something that is giving Trump cover
14:55:48 for his failures around COVID, creating
14:55:51 material harm, physical harm to our community
14:55:55 members, particularly our elderly and the most
14:55:57 vulnerable, and essential workers, of which we
14:56:03 are a key part...   And also pointing out that
14:56:06 he's using this chaos that he and his
14:56:09 administration has created to fundamentally
14:56:11 threaten democracy.  And this is a chance for
14:56:14 us to tie our fate to the fate of those who
14:56:16 have been out in the streets in thousands of
14:56:19 cities and towns all over the country demanding
14:56:23 an end to racism, an end to police brutality.
14:56:26 Because what he's done is, in the name of
14:56:34 law and order, sent federal troops, armed, some -- often unidentified, arresting people
14:56:36 unlawfully and violating our constitutional
14:56:36 rights.
14:56:39 So in the same breath that we denounce
14:56:41 anti-Asian racism, we can also express
14:56:43 solidarity with the Black-led racial justice
14:56:46 movement in this moment, as well as against
14:56:48 authoritarianism.
14:56:51 Why this matters is because...   Hello.
14:56:55 We have an election coming up in -- very
14:56:57 shortly.  And we need to unite with as many
14:57:01 people as possible to say that we are the
14:57:04 majority; Americans won't be divided; we won't
14:57:04 take the bait.
14:57:07 The other piece of this is that we are
14:57:10 living at a time where there is a general rise
14:57:13 in authoritarian tendencies, not just in the
14:57:16 United States and not just among white people.
14:57:19 And so part of our task, as well, is to
14:57:21 challenge authoritarianism and nationalism in
14:57:26 all of its forms.  We've seen the horrors of
14:57:33 Hindu nationalism in India; we've seen the
14:57:38 violence of, you know, sort of Jewish
14:57:42 nationalism in Israel; we've seen, obviously,
14:57:47 the brutality and anti-Semitic violence and
14:57:50 racist violence of white nationalists in the
14:57:53 United States.  We're also seeing people --
14:57:55 (audio garbling)   -- being pulled into some
14:57:57 right-wing movements, including what we're
14:58:00 calling the Chinese Tea Party, which is
14:58:04 something that ChangeLab and people like Alex
14:58:10 Tom, Kathy Deng, and others, we've been looking
14:58:13 into.  A fairly recent familiar that really
14:58:17 became visible in the wake of the death by
14:58:21 police officer Peter Leang.  And Peter Leang
14:58:28 was indicted, while groups like CAAV,
14:58:32 Communities Against Anti-Asian Violence, and
14:58:35 others who are united against police abuse,
14:58:37 were demanding accountability for Peter Leang,
14:58:40 tens of thousands of Chinese -- immigrants,
14:58:43 mainly, were turning out in cities around the
14:58:46 country and in Canada to demand that Leang not
14:58:49 be indicted, saying that it was anti-Chinese,
14:58:51 that it was racist while other white cops are
14:58:52 not being indicted.
14:58:56 So this was a moment where we sort of
14:58:58 paused and had to do some research about where
14:59:01 they were coming from.  And again, back to the
14:59:04 point of what shapes Asian American politics
14:59:07 and Asian American experiences, we found that
14:59:10 half of all Chinese immigrants in the United
14:59:13 States today arrived since 2000.  This is the
14:59:17 result of U.S. immigration policy.  The 1990
14:59:22 Immigration Act vastly favored high-skilled and
14:59:26 wealthier immigrants.  Today, Chinese --
14:59:31 mainland China represents 90% of EB 5 visas.
14:59:35 That's the visa where you can invest $500,000,
14:59:38 create some U.S. jobs, and basically buy your
14:59:39 way into a green card.
14:59:41 So the demographics of the Chinese
14:59:44 American population have changed dramatically.
14:59:47 At the same time, there's a misunderstanding,
14:59:50 fundamentally, by mainstream America of who we
14:59:52 are as Asian Americans politically.  Most
14:59:56 people, media pundits, will say, oh, Asian
14:59:58 Americans are naturally conservative, when in
15:00:02 fact the vast majority of Asian American voters
15:00:08 voted for Clinton in 2016, support progressive
15:00:11 politics across the board.  Chinese is the only
15:00:13 ethnic group within the Asian American and
15:00:19 Pacific Islander coalition, in terms of voters,
15:00:21 whose support for affirmative action has
15:00:25 declined.  The vast majority of Asian American
15:00:27 voters support affirmative action.
15:00:29 So these are ways in which politics are
15:00:31 shifting as a result of changes in the global
15:00:33 economy, changes in U.S. immigration policy,
15:00:36 and what it has to do with our broader sort of
15:00:38 agenda and project of racial justice in the
15:00:40 United States.
15:00:42 I think -- I'm not sure how I'm -- how am
15:00:45 I doing on time?
15:00:50 SPEAKER:  You're actually doing great,
15:00:53 'cause we're about to get into Q&A?  So the
15:00:56 pause was great.  So I've got a spotlight on
15:00:59 you -- again, back to Krystal with the
15:01:02 spotlight video.  Hi, Krystal.  Thank you,
15:01:04 Christina.
15:01:07 So we could pause here, if that's okay?
15:01:09 Is there anything you want to add?
15:01:10 SOYA JUNG:  Sure!  There's a lot to cover,
15:01:15 but I will -- I trust that it will all come out
15:01:17 in the Q&A.
15:01:19 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Well, I think some of it
15:01:22 can pack with some of the Q&A?  You know,
15:01:24 really phenomenal you've put a whole timeline.
15:01:26 I'm always impressed how, like, you can bring
15:01:31 everything in a little package of 30 minutes of
15:01:34 a historic timeline.  So I'm really
15:01:36 appreciative!  (Laughing)  You spoke so much
15:01:38 about everything from the history of
15:01:42 immigration, migration, to the history and
15:01:45 connection to -- from social control, racial --
15:01:47 and the racialization, all the way down to like
15:01:50 how the -- a little bit of mentions of the
15:01:52 model minority myth.  And also, like, I'd like
15:01:55 to unpack so many of the things you lifted up,
15:01:58 in terms of Hindu nationalism, the Chinese Tea
15:02:00 Party.  There's so much to go with this.  And
15:02:05 hopefully everyone who's chiming in can ask and
15:02:06 unpack questions.
15:02:07 But I think we can start with the question
15:02:10 of, like, since you named a lot of this history
15:02:14 in this timeline, I mean, what we're curious
15:02:16 about here as we're doing work around
15:02:19 organizing and bridging these gaps between the
15:02:22 institutional and the organizing work, and your
15:02:26 extensive 20-year, over 20-year work...   What
15:02:28 do you see of what makes that different from
15:02:32 when organizing movements from then to now, and
15:02:34 similar works of cross-racial solidarity,
15:02:37 right?  How are we doing that, from then and
15:02:39 now?  Especially in this current time of
15:02:42 fascism.  And all that you've mentioned in
15:02:45 terms of...   of the rise of Hindu nationalism,
15:02:48 the rise of the Chinese Tea Party, as well as
15:02:52 even just going back to the history of, like,
15:02:54 how the white nationalism, but even how we see
15:02:57 that fascism growing.  What are you seeing in
15:03:00 the difference from what you've known then and
15:03:03 what you've known, what you know now?  And what
15:03:06 have you learned, and what are our remaining
15:03:09 lessons to do?
15:03:13 SOYA JUNG:  Yeah!  Well, one of the
15:03:19 things...   Right now, we are -- there's so
15:03:21 many changes that have fed into the multiple
15:03:24 crises we're facing now.  We're facing a COVID
15:03:27 crisis.  We've been in a climate crisis.  We
15:03:30 are in a political crisis!  If you want to talk
15:03:32 about money and politics and sort of the
15:03:36 treatment of special interests in U.S.
15:03:39 politics...   We are facing a racial crisis
15:03:42 that we've been facing for a long time.  Health
15:03:44 care crisis.  The bridge between, gap between
15:03:46 the rich and the poor.  Et cetera!
15:03:49 So I think in this moment, as Black Lives
15:03:54 Matter and the Movement for Black Lives has
15:03:57 created so much political space for people to
15:04:01 be having conversations about race, from the
15:04:04 public sphere to the private sector, it is
15:04:07 fundamentally creating opportunities for us to,
15:04:09 again, as I said, narrate the crisis.  This is
15:04:11 what happens in a crisis!  All sides are
15:04:13 jumping in to say, this is why what's happening
15:04:16 to you is happening to you.
15:04:20 White nationalism...   is much more
15:04:24 visible and emboldened now, as a movement, as a
15:04:29 social movement, as a...   political movement,
15:04:35 than, let's say, 1968, when the Third World
15:04:38 student strike happened at San Francisco State.
15:04:41 I think that's something to take very
15:04:45 seriously.  We have a balance of forces now in
15:04:49 which, look, Trump is not a dictator who just
15:04:51 seized power!  Trump was elected!  Right?  I
15:04:55 mean, we can talk about voter fraud and 2016
15:04:58 being the first election that took place after
15:05:03 the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, and all
15:05:05 of those things are true.  Nevertheless, he was
15:05:07 elected, and we have to compete with that,
15:05:09 which means we have to compete with them and
15:05:12 marginalize them.  The good news is that only
15:05:15 3% of the American public supports -- what
15:05:16 white nationalism stands for.
15:05:18 Our challenge, I think, is that we have to
15:05:21 make ourselves, as the racial justice movement,
15:05:24 as Asian Americans, as Black people, as
15:05:27 Indigenous people, as Latinx people, and white
15:05:30 people, a majority, we have to make ourselves
15:05:34 really legible to...   to mainstream America.
15:05:35 Right?
15:05:40 So I think that all of the conversations
15:05:41 that are happening around policing and
15:05:44 defunding the police are critical right now.
15:05:48 And there are ways in which that demand creates
15:05:51 space for us to talk not just about policing,
15:05:55 but just budgeting in general!  Right?  It's
15:05:58 not about just defunding the police; it's also
15:06:00 about funding programs and systems that are
15:06:02 good for all of us.
15:06:04 And so there's a lot of room in there.  I
15:06:07 think it's a very different moment, in another
15:06:12 way, if you look at global politics, and Kandi,
15:06:16 you know this very well...   1968 was a time
15:06:19 of, kind of...   post colonial liberation
15:06:21 movements, national liberation movements.
15:06:26 We're seeing a different kind of nationalism
15:06:29 now that is not liberatory; it's more
15:06:34 oppressive, right?  So, on a global scale,
15:06:37 you're seeing -- whether it's, you know,
15:06:41 Hungary, or Russia, or the Philippines, or
15:06:44 whatever, you're seeing a lot of authoritarian
15:06:45 governments saying:  This is who belongs in the
15:06:47 nation, and this is who doesn't belong in the
15:06:49 nation.  And they're doing all sorts of
15:06:52 terrible things!  And in many cases are, again,
15:06:54 quote-unquote "freely elected."
15:06:58 So, I think we need to really figure out
15:07:04 how to push for all of our demands to make...
15:07:10 to make this time of reconstructing democracy?
15:07:16 You know -- WEB Dubois wrote Black
15:07:19 Reconstruction, right?  And in it, the subtitle
15:07:23 is the role African-Americans have played in
15:07:25 reconstructing democracy in me think.  I think
15:07:29 that's how we should position ourselves!  In
15:07:31 America.  We should position ourselves as
15:07:33 people who, once and for all, are fighting for
15:07:37 the truly inclusive multiracial democracy that
15:07:38 America says it wants to be and that we're
15:07:39 helping to make real.
15:07:41 I don't know if that answers your
15:07:43 question.  The other thing I would say is that
15:07:45 there are opportunities within labor, and the
15:07:49 labor movement, to construct a new kind of "we"
15:07:52 that really, you know, crosses racial
15:07:53 differences, acknowledge those racial
15:07:56 differences, but understands that we do have a
15:07:59 linked fate.  We have a shared fate as workers,
15:08:02 right?  In creating an economy that isn't
15:08:03 just...   exploiting workers in a race to the
15:08:05 bottom?  That provides us with the protections
15:08:09 that we need?  That gives us, you know,
15:08:10 universal health care and education and
15:08:13 unemployment and all of those things.  As well
15:08:16 as thinking about the future of the economy!
15:08:20 You know, this is not a sustainable system.
15:08:23 We...   are living in an age of technology
15:08:26 where capital needs fewer and fewer humans to
15:08:29 make profit, right?  And so we need to, as a
15:08:32 movement, also think about that.
15:08:33 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Wow.  Thanks for that,
15:08:36 Soya.  We also have more questions that came in
15:08:44 in the Q&A chat.  We can start with Shengxiao's
15:08:46 question on:  What are strategies that have
15:08:51 worked well to convince folks to not take the
15:08:53 bait of racial capitalism that has
15:08:56 strategically tried to divide us?
15:08:58 SOYA JUNG:  Mm-hmm.  Well, I know that,
15:09:00 you know, in Washington State there's a great
15:09:05 organization called Firelands Together that's
15:09:09 organizing in majority white, but also rural
15:09:13 counties.  They have really been hollowed out,
15:09:16 and they don't have a base of revenue.  A lot
15:09:18 of times, maybe there's a prison constructed or
15:09:20 a jail, and that's where people are getting
15:09:22 jobs, et cetera.  And they are really thinking
15:09:25 about this.  Thinking about, you know, well...
15:09:28 we did take the racial capitalism bait, and it
15:09:30 didn't serve us!  We're still screwed.  Or
15:09:32 maybe we didn't, and we never will, because of
15:09:36 this reason.  Because we know that -- you know,
15:09:39 Trump basically punches down?  He and his white
15:09:41 nationalist followers are saying, the reason
15:09:45 this is happening to you, everyday white
15:09:50 worker, is because of his parasitic Black and
15:09:53 Brown people -- actually, elites!  Which is
15:09:56 code word for Jewish people.  Are taking your
15:09:58 stuff and giving it to Black and Brown people.
15:10:01 Right?  That's the narrative.  And we, instead,
15:10:09 should punch up.  Right?  We should say, look,
15:10:11 who's really the problem is the rich and
15:10:13 powerful who for not even just decades, but
15:10:16 centuries, have been taking all of our stuff!
15:10:18 (Laughing)  You know?  And then sort of making
15:10:19 us fight for scraps.
15:10:21 And I think that that does work?
15:10:23 Especially if you make it really locally
15:10:26 relevant, you know?  So you look at a county
15:10:29 where there has been no replacement for a
15:10:32 timber-dependent economy.  There's been no
15:10:35 retraining.  There's been no investment in
15:10:37 green jobs, or you know, things like that.  Or
15:10:40 health care!  You know.  Once you start really
15:10:44 sort of reframing this as a problem about...
15:10:47 you know, concentrated power by the few?
15:10:50 That's screwing over the many?  And ways that
15:10:52 we can really come up with solutions that work
15:10:53 for everyday people, in terms of their
15:10:57 interests, around health care, around safety,
15:11:01 around, you know, jobs and...   and, and
15:11:03 education.  Things like that.
15:11:04 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Yeah, that's really
15:11:07 powerful to think about it as the punch up,
15:11:09 right?  And I mean, we should have learned that
15:11:13 we took the bated then, and it didn't work!
15:11:17 We do have some other questions here.
15:11:19 From:  How do you see narrative change as a
15:11:21 piece of building power, and what is the
15:11:23 intersectionality of this narrative of people
15:11:26 of color to build meaningful progress in
15:11:28 present time?
15:11:32 SOYA JUNG:  Yeah!  Yep!  (Clears throat)
15:11:37 I think narrative change is critical.
15:11:41 Especially -- oh, the other thing I was gonna
15:11:43 say, in terms of your question, Kandi, about
15:11:45 what's different about this time, is obviously
15:11:47 social media.  You know, information is moving
15:11:49 rapidly.  Misinformation and disinformation is
15:11:52 moving rapidly.  And it's like a fire hose
15:11:54 everyday, right?  We're getting tons of it.
15:11:57 And it's very, very polarized.  So we're not
15:11:59 all getting the same information.
15:12:03 But I think narrative change is really
15:12:05 important.  One of the times -- one of the
15:12:10 things about times of crisis is that...   we
15:12:15 make change by building the strongest, most
15:12:18 durable alliances that...   represent people
15:12:21 power!  Which means political power, right?  So
15:12:26 I think that...   constructing the biggest "we"
15:12:28 possible, and really talking about racism as
15:12:31 being fundamentally anti-democratic, you know?
15:12:34 Because most Americans believe in democracy;
15:12:35 most Americans believe in inclusion, and
15:12:38 diversity, and things like that.  I don't think
15:12:41 that we've penetrated enough the conversation
15:12:47 that...   you know, racism is what has caused
15:12:48 the shredding of the social safety net.  Racism
15:12:53 is what has caused the huge role of money in
15:12:55 politics.  If you care about climate, you
15:12:59 should care about racism.  I think people like
15:13:04 Cop Hopkins at Sierra Club has done a really
15:13:08 good job of articulating that.  That, you know,
15:13:13 climate, pollution, hasrd don't abide by racial
15:13:17 borders or racial differences, right?  If you
15:13:19 have vulnerable differences, you have a
15:13:20 vulnerable society.
15:13:22 So all of these things, you have to link
15:13:25 back, keep coming back, to the different
15:13:27 impacts of these racist policies, and
15:13:28 understanding that if you care about any of
15:13:32 these things, you have to sort of join forces
15:13:35 and work together against racism.
15:13:37 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Yeah.  Thanks for that!
15:13:39 We have about, I believe, seven more minutes.
15:13:42 So there's some time to still unpack a few more
15:13:44 things, Soya.
15:13:46 Some other questions, I want to get to
15:13:51 some of these...   Here we go.  Here's a
15:13:53 question:  "I've heard folks express previously
15:13:56 that U.S. anti-Asian racism is predicated on
15:13:58 U.S. anti-Blackness.  Can you provide any
15:14:00 thoughts you have on that?  How might you
15:14:02 suggest we hold that as we organize for racial
15:14:06 justice in this moment?"
15:14:10 SOYA JUNG:  U.S. anti-Asian racism is
15:14:15 predicated on U.S. anti-Blackness...?
15:14:20 Okay.  I had a slide I was gonna show you
15:14:26 guys.  (Laughs)  That...   is basically a
15:14:30 three-legged stool of white supremacy.  And so
15:14:33 that question of, you know, was slavery about
15:14:38 anti-Blackness alone, or...   And if so, does
15:14:41 anti-Blackness have any kind of...   anything
15:14:45 to do with capitalism and the economy?
15:14:50 So, this stool, the three legs are war and
15:14:57 imperialism; slavery; and genocide, Indigenous
15:15:00 genocide.  But each leg has a price tag on it.
15:15:04 (Laughs)  You know?  And the price tag is land,
15:15:06 labor, and empire.
15:15:11 So, I think that if you -- I think that if
15:15:15 you think about anti-Asian racism as racism
15:15:18 that only affects Asian people, it gets too
15:15:21 confusing.  Right?  For example, in 1833,
15:15:24 Britain outlawed slavery!  And then it started
15:15:29 ramping up its Coolie trade, right?  So
15:15:32 basically transporting indentured workers.
15:15:35 Coolie is a very derogatory term, but that's
15:15:39 what it was called.  Of indentured workers from
15:15:42 Asia into its colonies in the Americas, and in
15:15:45 Africa and the Pacific, right.
15:15:51 So...   You know, I like to say that, when
15:15:53 people say Black Lives Matter, one way to think
15:15:57 about it is that when Black life matters less,
15:15:59 life matters less!  Right?  And other people
15:16:05 get to be exploited in that same logic.  Of
15:16:07 people...   don't have, don't get to own their
15:16:09 bodies and their labor.  Right?
15:16:13 So anti-Asian racism is rooted in that, as
15:16:16 well as in imperialism.  As in just sort of
15:16:18 thinking about Asian people as being subhuman,
15:16:21 or superhuman, as the case may be with the
15:16:23 model minority myth.  But you know.  And
15:16:25 disease-ridden, et cetera.  And that's the
15:16:28 majority of U.S. history!  Right?  The model
15:16:32 minority myth is a blip in U.S. history.  That
15:16:36 really started sort of around World War II.
15:16:38 So I think it's important for us to
15:16:41 realize that, again, you know, nobody is safe
15:16:43 in this system?  So you can talk about the
15:16:45 specificity of anti-Asian racism in this
15:16:47 moment, and the ways that Chinese people and
15:16:50 Asian Americans are being linked to COVID.
15:16:53 That is, you know, definitely linked back to
15:16:57 Trump and his allies' language around the
15:16:59 "Chinese virus," et cetera.  But he didn't
15:17:01 create that!  That has a long legacy.  So he's
15:17:04 pulling that, again, out of the recycling bin,
15:17:07 bringing it out, and then animating this kind
15:17:10 of hateful violence that we're seeing right
15:17:10 now.
15:17:13 So, I guess that's...   Those are my
15:17:18 comments around -- I don't -- racism is racism?
15:17:22 There's definitely, again, different kinds of
15:17:25 experiences and impacts.  But that leg of
15:17:29 slavery and exploited labor is a place that has
15:17:31 definitely affected Asians.  That leg of war
15:17:35 and imperialism has definitely affected Asian
15:17:40 Americans.  And, as well as settler colonialism
15:17:41 has definitely affected Asian Americans.
15:17:43 There's no way that, you know, Chinese workers
15:17:46 could have been exploited in building the
15:17:48 railroads had, you know, Indigenous people not
15:17:51 been removed forcibly.  So -- does that make
15:17:53 sense?
15:17:54 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Yes.  I -- definitely.
15:17:56 So I think you laid the foundation for
15:18:00 understanding that concept of an understanding
15:18:03 of where it all is -- I would say, like, Scott
15:18:05 often talks about, as the blueprint, right?
15:18:07 I wanted to -- there's one more question
15:18:10 we can have, 'cause we have about two more
15:18:14 minutes.  I know this one is a big one, 'cause
15:18:16 I think you even lifted this up in briefly
15:18:17 talking about upward mobility.  But someone
15:18:21 asked this question:  I think this ties back to
15:18:25 our families, and some of their beliefs.  The
15:18:32 question is, neo-/conservative family members
15:18:37 base their political leanings on immigrant --
15:18:40 oh, where'd it go?  It disappeared on me!
15:18:43 Where did it go!  It was here!
15:18:45 What can be offered -- I think it
15:18:48 disappeared.  Okay.  Be fostered in dialogue,
15:18:51 since data and research often ignored?  There
15:18:54 are more emotional responses.  How can we make
15:18:56 progressive ideas more palatable to Asian
15:18:59 migrants who have ingested conceits of white
15:19:00 capitalism?
15:19:01 SOYA JUNG:  Yeah, great question.  You
15:19:05 know, a couple decades ago, my friend Raven
15:19:08 Heavy Runner and I did some work where
15:19:12 immigrants, refugees, African-Americans,
15:19:16 U.S.-born Asian Americans, and Native
15:19:18 Americans.  And we were looking -- we wanted to
15:19:21 start conversations about race by starting with
15:19:25 colonization.  'Cause one of the things that we
15:19:27 found, particularly with recent immigrants and
15:19:29 refugees, is that concept of colonization is
15:19:31 much...   more readily accessible for them?
15:19:34 Than racism.
15:19:40 They can get to racism much quicker if we
15:19:43 start with colonization.  Because oftentimes,
15:19:48 they have -- they're coming from places where
15:19:50 there has been some experience, whether in
15:19:53 their lifetimes or not, of colonization that
15:19:55 has shaped their understanding of history and
15:19:57 their understanding of their place in the
15:19:57 world.
15:20:03 So I would just say that it's...   It's an
15:20:06 organizing problem, right?  So when you are
15:20:08 trying to sort of agitate with your family
15:20:13 members or other people around you who may not
15:20:15 agree with you off the bat, you want to sorta
15:20:17 ask questions about their own experiences and
15:20:21 draw...   some parallels, right?  Or some ways
15:20:24 for them to relate to what's happening to
15:20:40 African-Americans in the United States people.
15:20:47 in the United States around policing, or even draw on something like Tulsa, right?  Tulsa, Oklahoma, that was burned to the ground, violently destroyed by white people.
15:20:52 That history, they can probably relate to
15:20:55 as a business owner, or trying to get a leg up,
15:20:56 in the United States.
15:20:58 We can look at African-Americans pursuing
15:21:01 the American dream, right, to get shut down by
15:21:03 the racist constitution of Jim Crow.  And to
15:21:05 say that, okay, well, maybe this American dream
15:21:07 thing isn't really -- it's an empty promise,
15:21:09 right?  Because we know that the rich and
15:21:11 powerful is always going to have the ability to
15:21:14 shut it down.  For those of us who are really
15:21:14 yearning for it.
15:21:17 So, better to work together to create a
15:21:19 different kind of system.  Something like that!
15:21:21 You know?
15:21:26 I think...   Yeah!  You know.  Can't let
15:21:30 lecture, whatever.  You want to be deeply
15:21:32 curious about where people are coming from,
15:21:34 what they care about, what their experiences
15:21:37 have been, so.  And then start from there.
15:21:39 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Wow, thanks, Soya!  We
15:21:41 were able to do all that within these last few
15:21:44 minutes together with this Q&A, and a lot of
15:21:46 really great questions everyone asked.  And I
15:21:51 really appreciate you being here.  And also
15:21:52 part of the advisory committee, as well, making
15:21:53 this all happen?
15:21:56 And so we're about to go on our break, but
15:21:58 I just really want to thank you for joining us,
15:21:59 being part of the University for Justice and
15:22:02 Liberation, laying the foundation on the first
15:22:06 week of University for Justice and Liberation,
15:22:09 UJL, giving us this significant and important
15:22:11 timeline and historic background for all of us.
15:22:13 So thank you so much, Soya, for joining us.
15:22:16 Is there any last thoughts to add before
15:22:17 we get into break?
15:22:19 SOYA JUNG:  Only that I think that there's
15:22:21 some really critical organizing happening right
15:22:24 now, and ways to plug in.  So I know that this
15:22:27 is a time of great fear and anxiety for all of
15:22:31 us.  And those things are grounded in reality.
15:22:36 But we should know that we're not alone.  And
15:22:38 find our place in organizations and in
15:22:42 campaigns and in ways to sort of leverage this
15:22:44 movement moment, right?  And make the change
15:22:46 that we really want.  So.
15:22:48 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Thank you, Soya.  I
15:22:50 appreciate all that you do!  (Laughing)
15:22:51 All right!
15:22:53 SOYA JUNG:  Thank you!  I appreciate you,
15:22:53 too!
15:22:55 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Okay, so we're gonna get
15:22:58 into break before we bring in our next speaker.
15:23:00 And Greg will play some music.  I want to say
15:23:02 again, thank you for our ASL interpreters.  I
15:23:04 know there's been some issues with tech.  We
15:23:09 are trying to sort it out as we get into break.
15:23:13 So stay tuned, and we'll see you back here by
15:23:16 3:30!  Okay, everyone?
15:23:19 (baby in background)
15:23:24 (Music)
15:30:45 GREG CENDANA:  Whoo!  Hey, all right!  All
15:30:47 right.  I don't know about y'all, but...   When
15:30:53 I hear a little Mary J. Blige, I just, I get in
15:30:55 some kind of mood.
15:30:56 (music ends)
15:30:58 But welcome back, folks, to -- from our
15:31:02 break.  Hope you enjoyed some of that music.  I
15:31:06 know there was a request yesterday for some
15:31:13 90s.  I love some 90s, so was happy to oblige.
15:31:15 So look out for some of our favorites in the
15:31:16 next classes.
15:31:18 I'm really excited to introduce our next
15:31:23 speaker, who has been a friend, a comrade, a
15:31:26 sister, and continues to show up for me and all
15:31:29 of our communities.  I'm excited to introduce
15:31:33 Carmen Perez-Jordan.  Carmen has dedicated her
15:31:36 20-year career to advocating for many of
15:31:39 today's important civil rights issues,
15:31:41 including mass incarceration, gender equity,
15:31:43 violence prevention, racial healing, and
15:31:46 community policing.  She began as a probation
15:31:52 officer in Santa Cruz, California, where she
15:31:53 ran contemporaneous programming inside nearby
15:31:56 prisons with the Violence Prevention and
15:32:03 Community Development Organization, Barrios
15:32:07 Unidos, where she is now a board member.  She
15:32:10 founded an organization in 2017 and
15:32:13 subsequently led several mass mobilizations
15:32:18 which paralyzed New York City after the
15:32:21 nonindictment of the police officer who killed
15:32:22 Eric Garner in 2015.
15:32:26 As the cochair in the women's march on
15:32:30 Washington, she facilitated a joint process to
15:32:33 produce a statement of principles known as the
15:32:37 Unity Principles with other women of diverse
15:32:38 backgrounds.
15:32:40 She is on police reform and policy,
15:32:44 testifying at Obama's 21st Century Task Force
15:33:10 on Policing in 2015, and sought after by
15:33:10 elected officials who are serious about passing
15:33:10 drastic reforms.
15:33:10 Everybody, please join me in welcoming
15:33:10 Carmen Perez-Jordan.  Welcome, Carmen!
15:33:10 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  Hi!  I'm trying to
15:33:10 start my video, but it says I'm unable to.
15:33:12 GREG CENDANA:  Okay, one second.  Kandi,
15:33:15 can we get help with that, Kandi?
15:33:24 (Silence)
15:33:29 Is it working now, Carmen?
15:33:33 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  It says the host...
15:33:35 You can't start your video, because the
15:33:38 host has stopped it.
15:33:41 GREG CENDANA:  Okay, one second...
15:34:04 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Does that work now?
15:34:05 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  Hi!  (Laughing)
15:34:08 GREG CENDANA:  Awesome.  All right,
15:34:11 Carmen.  Well I'm going to pass it to you now.
15:34:15 Thank you so much again for being here.
15:34:16 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  Of course, of
15:34:17 course.  Well, thank you, Greg, thank you,
15:34:20 Kandi, thank you everybody who is tuning in.
15:34:23 Again, my name is Carmen Perez-Jordan.  I'm the
15:34:27 CEO/president of the Gathering for Justice.  So
15:34:29 I'm going to talk about a couple of things.
15:34:31 And so first, I want to just kind of share
15:34:34 a little bit about what this moment is teaching
15:34:37 us about the systems that we are in, or the
15:34:40 type of revolutionary action that is necessary.
15:34:43 I know that earlier today, you all discussed,
15:34:45 you know, some of the things that have happened
15:34:47 historically here in this country, particularly
15:34:51 with Asian immigrants and Asian Americans.  And
15:34:54 so first of all, one of the things that I feel
15:34:56 strongly about -- and you could see it across
15:34:59 my advocacy -- is that we should not accept
15:35:02 hate or racism from any -- in any form, against
15:35:06 any population.  The very first step that those
15:35:11 of us who are not Asian can take...   is making
15:35:15 sure that when there are memes that are posted,
15:35:17 or inappropriate things that are being shared
15:35:21 or said, that we don't perpetuate the
15:35:24 stereotypes, or even passively scroll past or
15:35:28 ignore these from friends and family.  And that
15:35:32 we really call people in, and try to educate
15:35:34 them about the importance of not necessarily
15:35:39 perpetuating the same type of systems that we,
15:35:43 as other individuals or people of color, are
15:35:44 trying to fight against.
15:35:48 And to begin to have the conversations
15:35:53 with our loved ones when they do this type
15:35:56 of...   they, they do share this type of
15:35:58 content.  If we can learn anything from this
15:36:01 moment, it's not a time for judgment, but a
15:36:04 time for dialogue.  Understanding
15:36:08 reconciliation and true solidarity.
15:36:13 What I feel is also preparing us.  I feel
15:36:16 that the root work of organizing we have to do
15:36:18 in this moment is dialogue, understanding, and
15:36:21 agreements.  I was having a conversation
15:36:23 earlier today with a couple who was talking
15:36:25 about their child being Black and Brown, and
15:36:28 being in a predominantly white environment
15:36:31 where, you know, racism is often the topic, and
15:36:36 her allies don't necessarily understand...
15:36:42 how racism impacts her life.  And so, again,
15:36:44 it's about -- you know, and I was talking about
15:36:48 the win which we could achieve, a conversation
15:36:51 that is rooted in dialogue and is really an
15:36:54 understanding, is to really have these
15:36:56 agreements amongst one another.  As my good
15:37:01 friend, Linda Sarsour often says, unity is not
15:37:03 uniformity.  We don't have to agree on
15:37:04 everything in order for us to show up for one
15:37:06 another, as long as there are agreements and
15:37:08 respect between us.  Relationships are really
15:37:12 the foundation of organizing.  There are lots
15:37:14 of tactics that one can use.  But without
15:37:16 strong relationships, actions are less
15:37:19 powerful.  Coalitions fall apart.  And more
15:37:22 harm can be caused.  So it's important that we
15:37:23 center these relationships.
15:37:25 And I often talk about the fact that I
15:37:31 want to enter a relationship with somebody that
15:37:32 is transformational and not transactional.  And
15:37:35 my relationship with Greg is certainly
15:37:42 transformational.  I believe...   and as Kandi,
15:37:44 I truly believe that, you know, Greg is a
15:37:47 family member to me, although we're not
15:37:50 necessarily blood-related.  I feel that when we
15:37:54 calls, I will answer, and vice versa.
15:37:58 And really, that is what solidarity looks
15:38:01 like.  The first step of solidarity is also
15:38:04 leaning in; it's listening, it's understanding;
15:38:07 it's showing up without expectations.  Other
15:38:11 than not to allow for racism to exist,
15:38:14 regardless of who is a target at the moment,
15:38:16 and to not be a bystander.
15:38:18 And not the -- you know, I don't want to
15:38:21 make it seem as though this is an easy task.
15:38:23 You know?  But I certainly want to welcome us.
15:38:25 I know that there is a conversation about Black
15:38:28 Lives Matter earlier today.  But I certainly
15:38:30 don't show up to Black Lives Matter protests
15:38:34 asking, what about Latinos?  What about
15:38:37 Chicanos being killed at the hands of police?
15:38:41 It's about me showing up in service of; it's
15:38:45 about me showing up -- also understanding, not
15:38:47 only our collective struggle, but also
15:38:50 understanding that there are differences in our
15:38:52 struggles!
15:38:54 And...   Checking in with one another.  I
15:38:57 know that at this moment, my friends are
15:39:01 sharing with me that it doesn't matter, you
15:39:04 know...   I have -- one of my best friends is
15:39:11 Korean; my other best friend is Laos.  And so I
15:39:13 also know that in this moment, every Asian
15:39:16 person is being looked at as Chinese.  And it's
15:39:19 really this racist rhetoric that is being
15:39:22 perpetuated by this government, which is the
15:39:25 President.  For me, it's very similar to how
15:39:29 Latinos get told that they're Mexican.  I know
15:39:31 a lot of my Salvadoran friends will say, you
15:39:34 know, I'm not Mexican.  And it's not for me to
15:39:36 take any offense to it, but it's also important
15:39:40 that we check in with our friends, with our --
15:39:42 especially our Asian friends, to make sure that
15:39:45 we are available to be of support.
15:39:48 As we tackle this growing climate of
15:39:54 anti-Asian racism, you know, it's just...   As
15:39:57 we're encouraging non-Asian folks who lean in
15:39:59 and to listen to our Asian siblings, it's
15:40:02 important that we encourage your communities,
15:40:04 your family and friends, to lean in and to also
15:40:07 listen to Black and Indigenous people.  It's
15:40:09 important not to compare our struggles, like I
15:40:11 said earlier today, because nobody wins when we
15:40:16 play the oppression Olympics.  We have to hold
15:40:19 space for both.  The pain and the trauma our
15:40:21 communities experience, while we're holding
15:40:23 space for the pain and the trauma of other
15:40:23 communities.
15:40:26 Oftentimes, I find myself speaking to my
15:40:29 mother, who is born in Mexico, not really
15:40:31 understanding my father's struggle, who is
15:40:34 actually a Chicano who's from here about four
15:40:37 to five generations.  His family didn't cross
15:40:39 the border; the border crossed them.  And so
15:40:41 there were moments when my mother would say
15:40:44 things like, why can't they just pull
15:40:46 themselves up from their bootstraps?  And I
15:40:48 would -- instead of, you know, getting upset at
15:40:51 her, I would try to educate her on the Chicano
15:40:55 struggle that happened in the 1930s, the 1950s,
15:40:57 and even before then.  So it's also about, you
15:40:59 know, making sure that as we're holding space
15:41:02 for other communities, and as these courageous
15:41:06 conversations are happening, that we're also
15:41:09 able to educate our family members, who are
15:41:11 also potentially the people that are not
15:41:14 understanding how their struggle is connected
15:41:15 to somebody else.
15:41:20 What some people may see as self-isolation -- and I say this because
15:41:24 oftentimes, we see isolated communities...
15:41:28 and some people actually see it as something
15:41:34 that may be...   a way of a community
15:41:38 separating themselves, not necessarily because
15:41:42 they feel that that is...   something that they
15:41:46 want to do.  I feel, oftentimes, it's a form of
15:41:48 protection.  If you look at the history of
15:41:52 what's happened in this country, especially
15:41:57 with the Chinese Exclusion Act -- and not to
15:42:00 say that there was no injustices happening to
15:42:02 the Asian community prior.  But that was really
15:42:04 the first time that we saw a law passed that
15:42:07 excluded a whole community.  And so again, for
15:42:11 me when I see communities isolating themselves,
15:42:13 it's not because I think that they don't want
15:42:16 to be in community with us, but it's also for
15:42:19 their self-protection.  It's a form of safety;
15:42:24 it's a form of economic safety
15:42:27 it
15:42:31 's spiritual safety;
15:42:35 and so forth.  This has become a form
15:42:36 of protection from spiritual oppression that
15:42:38 has happened over and over again in this
15:42:39 country.
15:42:40 And I love to quote one of the people that
15:42:45 I look up to, Cesar Chavez, when he says
15:42:47 preservation of one's own culture does not
15:42:49 require contempt or disrespect for other
15:42:49 cultures.
15:42:51 And so what I want to share with you all,
15:42:55 as well, is some of the...   the moments of
15:43:00 solidarity that we have seen in the past,
15:43:02 throughout history.  We've seen it over and
15:43:05 over in movements.  The type of solidarity that
15:43:09 is actually needed today.  From the Filipino
15:43:12 and Mexican solidarity in 1965, as they led the
15:43:16 largest strike in the world together forming
15:43:20 the United Farm Workers Movement.  To activists
15:43:26 like Gracie Lee Boggs, who was involved in the
15:43:33 Black freedom struggle of the 1960s.  And Yuri
15:43:37 Koshiyama.  And more recently, with Black Lives
15:43:41 Matter, immigrant rights, and migrant families
15:43:43 being held in camps.
15:43:46 And so I hope we are all encouraged to not
15:43:49 only lean in, but also understand as we are
15:43:51 trying to figure out how we have these
15:43:53 difficult conversations that we also step up,
15:43:57 and we lean in by leading as well.
15:44:00 I was watching, ironically -- I don't ever
15:44:03 really watch the news, nowadays, considering
15:44:07 there's just so much...   trauma that is on the
15:44:10 news -- but I did watch the fact that, you
15:44:14 know, in the last two months, there was over
15:44:18 600 incidents of anti-Asian racism!  And so I
15:44:22 thinkoften about how I show up in this space,
15:44:25 and now am I gonna be one of the people that
15:44:28 actually also fights against that?
15:44:31 And so I just, again, want to thank you
15:44:34 for this time, and those are actually my
15:44:38 comments for now.
15:44:40 GREG CENDANA:  Thank you, Carmen.  I
15:44:43 wanted to just take a moment to remind folks if
15:44:47 you all have questions, to feel free to include
15:44:53 them into the chat, or the Q&A function.  And
15:44:56 then we'll go ahead and get those questions to,
15:44:58 to Carmen.
15:45:00 So as we're waiting for questions from
15:45:03 folks, Carmen, I'm gonna just start with the
15:45:05 first one.  I know you talked a little bit
15:45:08 about this earlier on, just in terms of the
15:45:12 type of work that you've done.  I think, I'm
15:45:14 curious:  How are you able to connect kind of
15:45:16 the work that you've done in ending mass
15:45:21 incarceration...   and the, kind of the
15:45:23 experience that Asian Americans and other
15:45:28 immigrants experience in detention, and, like,
15:45:30 how do you talk about the cross-racial
15:45:31 solidarity piece of that, in terms of
15:45:34 understanding where the pain comes from, and
15:45:36 then the efforts that are needed to pass
15:45:38 particular policies?  Can you just share a
15:45:41 little bit about your thoughts on that?
15:45:42 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  Of course.  So, you
15:45:45 know, I have to say that I was...   somebody
15:45:50 who grew up in a community that was multiethnic
15:45:53 and multiracial.  So I feel like there's a
15:45:56 slight advantage to growing up in a very
15:45:59 diverse community.  I grew up with Chicanos and
15:46:08 Black folks and Filipinos and Samoans.  And so
15:46:10 a lot of the people in my community were facing
15:46:12 the same things that we were facing.  They were
15:46:14 facing poverty, police surveillance,
15:46:18 incarceration, domestic violence, or even
15:46:20 street violence.  And so when I think about the
15:46:22 work that I do inside the detention centers or
15:46:26 the prisons, it's only natural to include these
15:46:27 communities into the conversation and the
15:46:32 dialogue, whether it's around peace-keeping
15:46:35 inside facilities; whether it's also
15:46:39 highlighting cultural experiences, like Cinco
15:46:42 de Mayo or Juneteenth.  And I recently went
15:46:46 into Soledad prison a few months ago where we
15:46:50 saw a lot of Samoan folks and southeast Asians,
15:46:52 right?  I've seen that population increase
15:46:54 significantly in the prison population.  We
15:46:57 know of people like Eddie Zheng who did a
15:47:01 significant amount of time inside prison, who
15:47:06 also advocates for Asian American rights.  And
15:47:09 also...   you know, so when we think about the
15:47:12 policies, and the types of coalitions that we
15:47:16 build, they're always very diverse, right?
15:47:19 They're multiethnic, they're multicultural.
15:47:20 But when we think about the policies, we have
15:47:22 to look at it in a sense of also making room
15:47:25 for people to sit at the table.  So I certainly
15:47:32 can't speak about the Asian experiences.  I'm
15:47:43 not Asian.  I'm Chicana, I'm hip-hop,
15:47:45 basketball, you know?  (Laughing)  But making
15:47:47 sure they not only have a seat at the table,
15:47:50 but there's equity at the table for them to
15:47:52 actively participate, right?  Oftentimes we
15:47:54 talk about equality.  But if we're making room
15:47:56 for somebody that doesn't have, necessarily,
15:47:58 the ability to understand the language of the
15:48:01 justice system, then we're only using folks as
15:48:02 ornaments.
15:48:04 So for us, it's making sure that in our
15:48:07 coalitions that we build, in the work that we
15:48:10 do, whether it's inside prisons or whether it's
15:48:12 in community, that we make room for those that
15:48:15 are directly impacted by the issue.  And that
15:48:17 also includes -- you know, I went to UC Santa
15:48:22 Cruz, and you know, I remember -- like I
15:48:26 mentioned earlier, one of my best friends,
15:48:30 Masheila, she's Laotian, and I used to think
15:48:38 she's -- there's this misperception about Laos
15:48:41 and Thailand, right, and Thai people.  So it's
15:48:44 also knowing the numbers of who is currently
15:48:46 being impacted by what issue and how.
15:48:48 GREG CENDANA:  Yeah, I definitely
15:48:51 appreciate that.  Because I think even just
15:48:54 from an Asian American context and in our
15:48:56 community, we're clear there's diversity within
15:48:59 our communities.  So are southeast Asians
15:49:02 represented?  Are South Asians represented?
15:49:06 And then sometimes people like to lump us with
15:49:08 Pacific Islanders, and they say API.  And
15:49:12 engaging Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders
15:49:15 is a whole 'nother thing that not necessarily
15:49:17 every organization or umbrella or what not
15:49:17 deals with.
15:49:20 So I'm going to turn to some Q&A
15:49:23 questions.  There's one question here
15:49:24 reflecting on some of your earlier remarks
15:49:27 around, it's not a time for judgment but a time
15:49:29 for dialogue.  So this question is:  How can we
15:49:33 use this to speak across communities, in
15:49:35 particular to potential white allies and folks
15:49:38 who may be recruited or attempted to be
15:49:41 recruited into white nationalism?
15:49:42 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  That's a really
15:49:48 great question.  As somebody who was...   you
15:49:53 know...   one, I've been -- you know, we are
15:49:58 grounded in the Gathering for Justice on
15:50:01 violence.  And it's really about attacking the
15:50:03 forces of evil, not people doing evil.  And so
15:50:06 sometimes we can lump communities together,
15:50:09 specifically like white nationalists.  And I'm
15:50:12 gonna tell you, these conversations are not
15:50:14 easy.  Let me just be very clear.  This means
15:50:17 that there are moments when you know you're
15:50:19 getting into a conversation you may not be able
15:50:21 to achieve the goal that you want to achieve in
15:50:24 that conversation.  But it's really about
15:50:26 meeting people where they're at and championing
15:50:29 them to your cause, right?  Really being able
15:50:33 to tap into, kind of pull the heartstrings of
15:50:36 individuals.  We worked a lot with white women
15:50:39 when we were organizing the Women's March on
15:50:41 Washington in 2017, and it was very difficult
15:50:43 because a lot of the white women did not even
15:50:46 know their own privilege.  Right.  And so as we
15:50:49 women of color, who have been fighting against
15:50:53 injustice for 20-plus years, have a very
15:50:56 assertive tone, a lot of the white women were,
15:50:58 you know, essentially saying that they felt
15:51:04 very...   they felt as though we were speaking
15:51:06 to them in a harsh way.  And that wasn't the
15:51:07 case at all.
15:51:10 And so we have to have some of these
15:51:12 difficult conversations, understanding that
15:51:14 some of these women were also connected to
15:51:17 white supremacy!  Right?  And that we were not
15:51:23 gonna resolve all our ideals or all our
15:51:25 miscommunication, misunderstandings, in one
15:51:28 conversation.  So it takes quite some time.
15:51:30 But I will say that, you know, at the end of
15:51:34 the day, it's really not an easy conversation.
15:51:37 You meet people where they're at; you try to
15:51:41 champion them to your cause; but you also have
15:51:43 to make the decision whether or not this is
15:51:45 something that you want to invest your time in.
15:51:47 You know, we have a lot of difficult
15:51:50 conversations with individuals who are holders
15:51:52 of power and systems.  Right?  We have to
15:51:54 invite them into the conversation in order for
15:51:57 them to know how we're gonna hold them
15:51:59 accountable.  But it's not always the case when
15:52:02 it comes to white nationalists.  Again, I think
15:52:04 the first person you need to think about in
15:52:08 protecting is yourself.  But if you're really
15:52:11 about wanting to...   create some type of
15:52:15 change or understanding or common agreement,
15:52:18 then I think it's worth the conversation.
15:52:21 GREG CENDANA:  For sure.  Thanks, Carmen.
15:52:22 And I think one thing that I would just add to
15:52:26 that, too, is you kind of said like is it worth
15:52:29 it?  And I think one way that I've thought
15:52:32 about it is I know there's many in the Filipinx
15:52:36 and Filipino and Asian community more broadly
15:52:40 that I need -- my investment of my time in
15:52:42 trying to help move them along is, like,
15:52:44 important?  And at some point, we're going to
15:52:47 need to call on our white kind of allies who
15:52:49 understand, and who are politicized in a
15:52:51 different way, and be like, look!  You expect
15:52:55 me to get my people, other Asian Americans,
15:52:58 other LGBTQ folks, other folks that I identify
15:52:59 with.  So this is your responsibility and your
15:53:02 time, too?  To have to, like, get your cousins,
15:53:05 or your aunties, if you will, to like get them
15:53:09 in formation, too.  So that definitely
15:53:09 resonates.
15:53:12 So kind of build on this, this piece
15:53:15 around critical dialogue.  There's a question
15:53:19 now that's about, you know, some folks,
15:53:23 including some folks here on part of this UJL,
15:53:25 saying they're starting to hit walls with
15:53:27 family members when they're trying to lean in
15:53:30 and to open up some of that dialogue,
15:53:34 especially for folks that are loved ones or
15:53:36 folks in our families.  What strategies do you
15:53:39 have to promote either, like, not giving up, or
15:53:42 to prevent burn out?
15:53:43 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  So I have to say,
15:53:45 I'm looking at some of these questions, and I'm
15:53:47 smiling because these are all things that I
15:53:52 have faced throughout my life.  You know, I
15:53:55 remember working...   I started this career
15:53:59 very, very young.  And I think, because I was
15:54:02 the only person who went to college -- I'm the
15:54:05 youngest of five; I'm the only one who went
15:54:07 away to college -- my family was like, what are
15:54:09 you doing working with those people, right?
15:54:12 And "those people" are people that were
15:54:15 incarcerated, right?  Or, why are you talking
15:54:18 to those people?  And I remember just being so
15:54:21 frustrated.  One, I'll tell you where my
15:54:23 frustration came from, is I didn't have the
15:54:25 language, really, that I needed at the time in
15:54:27 order to have a very productive conversation.
15:54:29 I felt like I was being judged.
15:54:30 GREG CENDANA:  Mm-hmm.
15:54:31 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  And so, you know...
15:54:38 I will say that the burn out is -- it -- again.
15:54:39 Some of the most difficult conversations you're
15:54:41 gonna have are gonna be with your family
15:54:46 members.  And the reason is because oftentimes,
15:54:49 you have less patience for your family.  Right?
15:54:52 We could deal with somebody and never have to
15:54:54 see them again.  Unfortunately, you're having
15:54:58 to see -- (Laughing)  Some of these people!  At
15:55:01 a Thanksgiving, or a Christmas, or any type of
15:55:03 holiday.
15:55:05 And what I will say to you is, again, pick
15:55:08 your battles!  Right?  Find the language that
15:55:11 you need in order to really articulate what
15:55:14 you're feeling.  And you're right; it's
15:55:16 frustrating.  There are moments when I feel
15:55:18 it's not my responsibility to teach people, you
15:55:22 know?  There's also -- I will say, you know,
15:55:25 there are moments when, you know, people are
15:55:27 like telling me that I'm Spanish.  Particularly
15:55:32 in New York!  Latinos get called "Spanish."  Or
15:55:35 I get told I'm not Mexican because I don't look
15:55:38 Mexican or I don't speak Mexican.  But there
15:55:41 are moments when I find it to be...   you know,
15:55:44 instead of getting angry, the way I used to,
15:55:48 maybe back in the day?  Is that I try to ask
15:55:52 more questions, and I try to provide answers.
15:55:55 And so it's going to take time.  This is a
15:55:57 long-distance run.  When you're trying to
15:56:00 dismantle racial and classist biases within
15:56:04 your family and your community, it's about
15:56:07 sometimes just showing, and they're going to
15:56:10 come along at some point.  But again, the
15:56:13 conversations -- I think what I welcome you all
15:56:15 to do is to really consider taking care of
15:56:18 yourself.  If you don't have the energy, if you
15:56:20 don't have the bandwidth, if you don't have the
15:56:25 language at the time to really...   point
15:56:28 out...   the type of, maybe racist rhetoric
15:56:31 that they're saying?  Then I would take a pass.
15:56:33 And then bring it back to their attention when
15:56:37 you are fully rested, and when you do have what
15:56:39 you need in order to have a productive
15:56:42 conversation.  Not every conversation is worth
15:56:44 having, considering that, again, you don't want
15:56:50 it to be something that, you know -- people
15:56:53 know me, in my family.  They know I'm going to
15:56:56 talk about race, about issues, about
15:56:58 anti-Blackness.  I've now become that person?
15:57:01 But I will say I do it with a lot of love.  And
15:57:05 there were moments in my life when I didn't
15:57:06 have the type of love that I now have in my
15:57:07 heart.  And so again, I think it's just
15:57:09 something that you need to think about, that
15:57:13 you need to -- but I will say, learn about
15:57:16 history!  What's helped me throughout the years
15:57:19 is that I am very grounded in history of
15:57:21 different movements, of different struggles
15:57:26 across...   the country, of how the formation
15:57:28 of racism started here.  I went to UC Santa
15:57:33 Cruz and studied the founding of race and
15:57:36 privilege in this country.  And so I'm able to
15:57:39 actually, you know, sometimes drop a book, or
15:57:41 drop some knowledge, where people are kind of
15:57:44 like, okay, Carmen actually knows what she's
15:57:45 talking about.
15:57:46 GREG CENDANA:  Definitely.  Yeah, and I've
15:57:50 found, too, sometimes it's helpful to even just -- if you can't have the conversation, but
15:57:53 you maybe know a podcast or an article or a
15:57:55 book to recommend to folks, to say if you want
15:57:58 to learn more about this, here's a good
15:58:00 opportunity, an example of something you could
15:58:01 check out, too.
15:58:04 I want to build on -- 'cause since I've
15:58:07 met you, you've been -- what I know, you use
15:58:12 the term "femmetor" to so many young activists
15:58:16 and organizers who are building their
15:58:18 leadership and taking on different campaigns
15:58:20 that you're a part of.  Can you talk a little
15:58:22 bit about...   in terms of your approach to
15:58:29 being a femtor and helping develop folks, what
15:58:32 have you learned, and what are some of the
15:58:35 things you could offer now to folks who are
15:58:38 part of the UJL and considering themselves
15:58:40 organizers in training?
15:58:41 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  So, one, I always
15:58:43 think about our past movements and how they
15:58:46 were led by young people.  So I truly believe
15:58:47 that the relationship I have with young people
15:58:50 is a two-way.  Right?  So as much as they learn
15:58:54 from me, I learn from them.  I'm -- yo, I was
15:58:57 jamming!  To Mary, and to, you know, the music.
15:59:00 But I'm like, that's 90s music!  You know?  Our
15:59:02 young people are listening to something
15:59:05 completely different.  So I find the
15:59:08 relationship, one, I get so much energy and so
15:59:13 much...   you know.  It's one of the greatest
15:59:15 things that I feel I could ever do, is to
15:59:19 mentor somebody or femtor somebody.  It's
15:59:22 really, it's really about paying it forward.
15:59:29 To have somebody like a Harry Bellafonte, in
15:59:34 his 90s, somebody who's traveled the world
15:59:36 bringing peace between different gangs, another
15:59:39 person, bringing peace in prisons, or even a
15:59:43 Chicana feminist who consistently reminds me of
15:59:45 the power of a woman.  But even the connection
15:59:49 to Black and Brown solidarity?  The way in
15:59:52 which I view them, I feel like -- and they give
15:59:54 me so much?  Is what I try to give to young
15:59:54 people.
15:59:58 I love working with young people.  One of
16:00:00 our youngest employees at the Gathering for
16:00:02 Justice, who I was just talking about earlier
16:00:07 today, is Louis Hernandez, who initially came
16:00:10 to us at the age of 16 because his brother was
16:00:13 wrongfully accused and had spent two years at
16:00:15 Rikers.  But I see something in young people.
16:00:17 And unfortunately, when I was about 20 years
16:00:21 old, and my mentor, who was about 25, maybe 30
16:00:23 years older than me, told me he saw something
16:00:26 in me, I was like, eh, yeah, no.  I don't know
16:00:28 about you.  Like, that's a little weird!  And
16:00:31 ironically, I do that now.
16:00:33 And so what I welcome young people is we
16:00:34 always say that young people are the future,
16:00:37 but you're really the present.  You're the
16:00:39 greatest gift that we have.  It is really our
16:00:41 responsibility to open the doors for you.
16:00:43 Because I will say, I don't want you to
16:00:47 struggle the way in which I have.  However, it
16:00:53 is also, you know...   our responsibility to
16:00:57 cultivate you!  And that's what I feel is part
16:00:59 of, when I think about Black and Brown
16:01:01 solidarity, when I think about anti-Asian --
16:01:03 it's all interconnected, right?  And the fact
16:01:06 that, you know, I say that it is our
16:01:08 responsibility?  I also feel it's your
16:01:11 responsibility to connect to somebody who you
16:01:14 admire and just ask them to take you under
16:01:19 their wing.  Like, I don't see...   my
16:01:23 experience being any greater than Louis's.  I
16:01:27 certainly do check-ins with him.  I check in
16:01:28 with a lot of the young people that I mentor.
16:01:31 And I also feel like I'm a lot better in a
16:01:37 space when I have a young person near me.  Brea
16:01:40 Baker!  You know, I love to bring her onboard
16:01:42 and have conversations with her.  Because she
16:01:45 actually knows me more than I know myself,
16:01:47 right?  She could -- and so there's just so
16:01:50 much beauty in this intergenerational
16:01:53 relationship?  But I just feel like for those
16:01:55 of you -- you know, always think about
16:01:58 mentoring somebody.  Don't -- it doesn't matter
16:02:03 how old you are.  If you are a 17-year-old
16:02:05 organizer, if you are 20 -- there are children,
16:02:07 there are younger people that need your
16:02:09 support.  And so never feel like you're either
16:02:12 too old, or too young, or too anything to make
16:02:13 real change, because you really have the power
16:02:17 to do that.
16:02:18 GREG CENDANA:  So now there's another
16:02:22 question here on internationalism.  The
16:02:25 question is:  Can you speak to
16:02:26 internationalism, particularly its role in
16:02:30 liberation work, our role and responsibility in
16:02:32 making global connections, and groups you
16:02:34 recommend doing international solidarity?
16:02:40 Racial capitalism operates globally as
16:02:42 imperialism, and it seems that that gets lost
16:02:44 in analysis and action.
16:02:46 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  Yes.  So I mean, I
16:02:49 think...   in my early years of this work, a
16:02:51 lot of the work that I was doing was
16:02:54 international work.  And the reason why I'm so
16:02:58 committed to eradicating anti-Blackness, where
16:03:02 I see anti-Blackness in everything, even in the
16:03:04 fabric of this country, is because I traveled
16:03:07 the world.  I've gone to Venezuela and worked
16:03:15 with Afro Venezuelans, to Cuba and worked with
16:03:25 Cubbanos.  I've gone to Mexico and worked with
16:03:28 Afro Germans.  And what I've seen is what we
16:03:30 implement here in the United States ultimately
16:03:32 ends up the policy in another country.
16:03:33 For instance, I was part of a delegation
16:03:41 to travel to El Salvador to support a peace
16:03:43 policy between gang members.  And what I
16:03:46 learned is this iron fist policy that was
16:03:47 drafted out of Washington, D.C. was actually
16:03:49 the policy that was being implemented in El
16:03:52 Salvador.  And so everything that we do is all
16:03:55 interconnected.  And so oftentimes when we
16:03:57 think about foreign policy, or we think about
16:04:00 what's happening in another country, it's all
16:04:02 related back to the United States.  And
16:04:03 sometimes we're contributing to some of that
16:04:05 oppression.
16:04:07 And I say that because I've also traveled
16:04:10 to other countries, that I won't mention, where
16:04:14 we have fully funded the military, we have
16:04:17 fully funded the oppression of another
16:04:20 individual.  And so for me, it's important to
16:04:24 not only understand what's happening here in a
16:04:26 national -- or, in the context of the United
16:04:29 States, but also understand what's happening
16:04:32 across the globe because, again, it's all
16:04:34 interrelated, it's all interconnected.  And
16:04:38 capitalism is a big part of it.  It's the
16:04:41 reason why we oppress, you know, certain
16:04:46 communities!  We use, you know, slave labor!
16:04:51 Low wages!  I learned through Barrios Unidos, I
16:04:54 learned about fair trade!  It was something I
16:04:57 would have never learned at university, but I
16:04:59 learned it through my mentor who was talking
16:05:01 about fair trade coffee.
16:05:03 So yes, certainly there is...   I think,
16:05:05 you know -- one of the things that I was
16:05:09 invited -- I was invited to Venezuela, and
16:05:12 before going to Venezuela, my mentor had asked
16:05:16 me if I knew anything about their policies.
16:05:18 And I just went -- and this is probably not a
16:05:21 great example, but I went onto the computer and
16:05:24 I started Googling all these different things.
16:05:25 And I learned how much we were contributing to
16:05:27 the oppression of the people there, right?  But
16:05:30 also the fact that some of the things that
16:05:33 we're trying to dismantle here is also
16:05:35 connected to what we're trying to dismantle
16:05:38 across the board.  And it doesn't just end here
16:05:40 in the United States.  It needs to happen all
16:05:42 over the country.
16:05:47 GREG CENDANA:  So here's another question
16:05:50 here that was in the Q&A.  Folks are asking if
16:05:52 there is an example of having a conversation
16:05:54 with someone else, where you have to call out
16:05:58 racism or a racist remark while holding space
16:06:01 for others and building a nonjudgmental
16:06:04 dialogue.  Is there an example that you can
16:06:07 share, and kind of how you dealt with that?
16:06:08 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  Oh my god.  So.  I
16:06:10 have to tell you, I've been in this field for
16:06:14 so long, and all these questions are so on
16:06:18 point.  And I only say that because...   you
16:06:22 know, in some of our nonviolence training, in
16:06:24 our community nonviolence trainings, there were
16:06:27 some incidents where people who had just gotten
16:06:31 out of prison had been part of our training.
16:06:36 And in prison, as we know, they separate you by
16:06:38 race.  And as we were holding space and we were
16:06:41 doing this training, somebody called somebody a
16:06:45 derogatory term.  And then it went back.  And
16:06:48 we had to -- (Laughs)  We had to, you know, sit
16:06:50 there to really understand where this was
16:06:52 coming from.  So.
16:06:55 But again, it's not easy.  We do this in
16:06:58 different spaces, like, you know, when you
16:07:01 think about...   you know, conflict resolution?
16:07:03 You know, I would welcome you all to look into
16:07:06 like conflict resolution resources or
16:07:09 trainings.  I welcome you to also look into
16:07:11 community nonviolence trainings, or even look
16:07:14 into the six principles of nonviolence, that
16:07:17 allow you to kind of step outside of the
16:07:19 immediate conversation that's happening where
16:07:22 you're having to call somebody out, or you're
16:07:24 having to hold space, and to actually think
16:07:26 about what the long-term goal is.  Right?  So
16:07:29 if you think about community nonviolence, it's
16:07:33 really about...   a reconciled world.  And that
16:07:36 is the end goal, is to make sure that there's
16:07:39 some form of reconciliation.
16:07:42 And so as we talk about solidarity, as we
16:07:44 talk about calling out racism, what type of
16:07:47 world and environment are you trying to live
16:07:48 in?  And so when you keep your eyes on the
16:07:51 prize, when you're looking at the prize, and if
16:07:53 it's reconciliation, then you're able to have
16:07:55 that difficult conversation.  But it happens
16:07:59 all the time.  Again, I'm in spaces where
16:08:01 people don't know I know a specific language.
16:08:02 There are spaces where I'm being called a
16:08:05 certain thing.  I get told to go back to
16:08:10 Mexico.  Right?  And so there are times when
16:08:15 I'm really grace -- you know, I have a lot of
16:08:16 grace?  (Laughs)  And then there's times where
16:08:22 I have to, you know, flip my neck a little bit.
16:08:24 And it kind of depends on what my goal is.  If
16:08:26 I want to make sure there's some form of
16:08:29 reconciliation, or that I want them to feel the
16:08:33 type of pain that I'm feeling at the time.
16:08:34 GREG CENDANA:  Okay.  Because I know that
16:08:38 you've worked with kind of a variety of folks
16:08:40 and different backgrounds and experiences,
16:08:42 there's a question here, and I'm curious if you
16:08:46 have any particular thoughts on this, in terms
16:08:49 of...   What's the -- like, are their resources
16:08:51 or guides that are the best approach to
16:08:54 approaching C-suite or executive-level
16:08:58 conversations, in terms of like CEOs and
16:09:00 presidents and kind of folks in those types of
16:09:02 positions?
16:09:12 (Silence)
16:09:20 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  There, um -- can you
16:09:21 hear me, Greg?
16:09:23 GREG CENDANA:  Yeah, I can hear you.  Can
16:09:25 you hear me?
16:09:26 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  Hello?
16:09:28 GREG CENDANA:  Oh...   We can hear you.
16:09:39 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  Can you hear me?
16:09:42 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  Okay.  I think my
16:09:47 internet was unstable for a little bit.  Um...
16:09:53 So, I will say...   there was a curriculum
16:09:56 that I helped develop called Daring
16:09:58 Discussions.  But there's also, Greg, I know
16:10:02 that we've been in spaces where folks...
16:10:06 there's curriculum around courageous
16:10:08 conversations.  I think that people could look
16:10:11 into them.  So there's Courageous
16:10:12 Conversations, again.  There's apples the six
16:10:19 six -- also the six principles of nonviolence.
16:10:22 There's...   the other resource that I had
16:10:26 mentioned, where, you know, conflict
16:10:29 resolution?  That also really prepares you to
16:10:32 have an executive-level conversation.  It's
16:10:36 just about seeing what fits you.
16:10:39 But I know that some of the Courageous
16:10:42 Conversations, what we were looking at doing is
16:10:44 really making sure that we had agreements.
16:10:46 That's what I was talking earlier about, the
16:10:47 fact that what is the agreement that you're
16:10:49 making to yourself, and how are you
16:10:51 communicating that agreement when you're
16:10:54 walking into a conversation?  What is your goal
16:10:57 of the conversation?  And then how could you
16:11:00 use language -- we often talk about the "I"
16:11:02 statements.  It kind of seems really like, you
16:11:05 know, I don't know, high school?  But "I"
16:11:08 statements are so important.  Instead of saying
16:11:11 "you," it's really about I personally feel, or
16:11:13 I feel this way, or whatever it may be.
16:11:16 But I'm hoping that, Greg, maybe I could
16:11:17 find something online, and I could share with
16:11:20 you so that you could share it with them, and I
16:11:22 could provide a couple of resources.
16:11:23 GREG CENDANA:  For sure.  For sure.
16:11:25 Yeah, and one thing that I would add to
16:11:29 that, too, is I think the thing about C-suite
16:11:31 or executive-level folks is understanding their
16:11:33 power or role within the institution.
16:11:35 Sometimes folks want to create space to have
16:11:38 conversation, but aren't willing to give up
16:11:42 some of that privilege, or to assert that they
16:11:44 need to invest resources into actually some of
16:11:46 the things that they're saying, and that might
16:11:50 mean shifting and making some of those
16:11:51 difficult conversations, too.
16:11:53 So I think to build on your point, of like
16:11:56 it depends on the goal, it's like, okay,
16:11:57 there's a lot of ways to have conversations
16:11:59 with folks, but what are you really trying to
16:12:01 get out of?  And what are you willing to give?
16:12:03 And what are you willing to give both in terms
16:12:05 of your role, like your executive role, but
16:12:08 also in your role in this larger organization
16:12:10 or system?  And are you willing to give up some
16:12:13 of that, if that's what it comes to?
16:12:15 And I think that tension there is one that
16:12:18 sometimes is harder to push people on.  And so
16:12:21 I would -- I'm not sure who asked that, but
16:12:23 that's something that I would offer, as well.
16:12:23 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  And even before
16:12:26 that, Greg, right, before we get to like what
16:12:28 are they willing -- what's the negotiation?
16:12:32 Right?  So like, that's why I said, in the six
16:12:35 principles of nonviolence, there's also six
16:12:37 steps that walk you through a process in order
16:12:39 to kind of achieve your goal.  Right.  So
16:12:42 before the reconciliation, there's negotiation.
16:12:44 So also really understanding, like, what are
16:12:48 you willing to negotiate in the power dynamic?
16:12:50 And I think, you know, for those of us who
16:12:53 do organizing, we also do power mapping, and
16:12:55 sometimes you've gotta do power mapping with
16:12:58 some of the, you know, understanding the power
16:13:01 dynamics of the execs in whatever environment
16:13:02 you're in.
16:13:04 GREG CENDANA:  For sure.
16:13:07 So another question that folks wanted to
16:13:10 ask is around:  How do you avoid burn out?
16:13:12 'Cause I feel like a lot of the work that is
16:13:15 done is very, like, taxing, both physically and
16:13:18 emotionally and mentally.  I mean, especially
16:13:20 when you're having conversations in prisons, or
16:13:21 having conversations with folks who are
16:13:24 directly impacted.  There's a lot there to hold
16:13:26 and process with folks.  And so I'm curious,
16:13:29 like -- yeah.  How do you avoid burn out, and
16:13:31 then how does that also look like in the midst
16:13:33 of a pandemic?
16:13:34 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  So it seems as
16:13:36 though we're having a lot more conversations
16:13:38 since we've been on the pandemic, right?  It
16:13:42 seems like it's Zoom calls!  Zoom, Zoom, Zoom!
16:13:45 Zoom, Zoom, Zoom.  And, you know...   I always
16:13:47 say, if you're tired, take a nap.  It's as
16:13:51 simple as that.  Right?  But in reality, I feel
16:13:58 like...   you know, I could see that -- you
16:14:01 know...   Finding ways to take care of your
16:14:04 spirit is really important.  Finding ways to
16:14:08 take care of yourself is really important.  You
16:14:13 know, the...   there are times when you have to
16:14:16 say no to something!  And it's really about,
16:14:19 like, what do you see for yourself?  Like, I'm
16:14:25 a lifetime organizer, bridge-keeper.  Like,
16:14:28 this is my passion; this is what I feel is my
16:14:32 calling.  So, you may not see me...   I will
16:14:34 say, I've had to take a step back, because now
16:14:40 I have a baby; I'm about 8 months pregnant, 8
16:14:42 and a half months pregnant.  My husband is like
16:14:45 you can't travel to Kentucky and be in
16:14:48 solidarity with your sisters in Until Freedom.
16:14:50 And so that's hard for me, because I want to be
16:14:52 out.  I want to be out on the front lines,
16:14:55 showing up in solidarity, I want to have these
16:14:57 conversations.  But I do get tired.  You know.
16:15:01 But I also am spiritually grounded.  You know,
16:15:03 there are different ways in which people could
16:15:07 stay connected to something higher than
16:15:08 themselves.
16:15:12 And also just eliminate some of the...
16:15:14 relationships that drain you!  'Cause it's not
16:15:18 always about the work draining you.  It's also
16:15:20 about certain relationships that drain you.  So
16:15:22 just finding ways to take care of yourself,
16:15:24 take care of your spirit.  If you are connected
16:15:26 to something higher...   And I saw something
16:15:29 here about, like, solidarity!  Right?  It's
16:15:32 sometimes hard to constantly show up in
16:15:35 solidarity.  And how do you avoid feeling
16:15:38 burned out showing up in solidarity, right?
16:15:41 You know, for us, Greg, I know you've been
16:15:43 out there, too.  And you know, I constantly
16:15:45 show up for Black Lives Matter.  This is
16:15:48 something that I've done before the hashtag.  I
16:15:51 truly believe that once Black people are free,
16:15:55 my people will be free.  And so I also believe
16:15:59 that in other spaces.  I think solidarity, for
16:16:04 me, again is showing up in service of, and not
16:16:06 expecting anything back.  But I'm also human.
16:16:08 There are moments when my people are attacked,
16:16:12 especially around the election when Donald
16:16:14 Trump said some very inappropriate things about
16:16:16 Mexicans that I feel some of my peers didn't
16:16:20 show up.  And that came out, and that...   that
16:16:22 feeling manifested in different ways.  It
16:16:25 manifested in a way where I felt really sad; I
16:16:28 felt angry; I felt frustrated.  And it's okay
16:16:31 to feel that, as long as I'm able to have a
16:16:33 conversation with the people who I felt didn't
16:16:34 show up for me.
16:16:36 But then there's moments when I don't have
16:16:41 those conversations, and it sometimes builds
16:16:43 up?  So it's really about understanding, like,
16:16:45 yourself and your own body, when you're in a
16:16:47 space with somebody else and you're showing up
16:16:48 for somebody else's cause.
16:16:51 GREG CENDANA:  Got it.  I think it's
16:16:54 probably -- we have probably time for one more
16:16:57 question.  This is probably just building on
16:17:00 your previous response, Carmen, around just
16:17:01 spiel grounding.  They're asking, if you're
16:17:03 willing or comfortable, like, can you talk a
16:17:05 little bit more about what that looks like and
16:17:07 how you do it?  And if you have any
16:17:11 recommendations for folks seeking a strong
16:17:12 spiritual practice?
16:17:14 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  So, of course.  I
16:17:19 will say, I am...   I was raised, um, in the
16:17:23 Catholic Church.  That was from my mother's
16:17:25 side.  And then my basketball coach used to
16:17:29 take us to Baptist church.  And then my little
16:17:32 friends used to take me to Christian church.
16:17:35 and as long as I was praying to somebody higher
16:17:37 than myself, my mom was like, it's cool, you
16:17:41 can be out there.  But when I got to UC Santa
16:17:49 Cruz, I connected to Barrios Unidos, who really
16:17:51 practice in the Lakota practicing.  They
16:17:54 practice sweat lodge, and they sage, and things
16:17:54 like that.
16:17:57 So for me, I have an altar.  I have, in
16:17:59 the morning, when I'm feeling really dragged
16:18:02 down, I go -- (Laughs)  My husband actually
16:18:04 does this to me, as well.  He'll see that I may
16:18:08 be a little snappy?  And he'll bring the sage.
16:18:11 And he'll start smudging me!  Um, but I am -- I
16:18:15 pray a lot.  I pray to the Creator.  I give
16:18:19 thanks.  One thing that I do often is before I
16:18:22 plant my feet on the ground, I am -- I say
16:18:25 three things that I'm grateful for.  And I try
16:18:27 to switch it up.  I try not to always say that
16:18:30 I'm grateful for my son or my husband or my
16:18:32 parents.  I really try to think about the day
16:18:35 before, and really acknowledge what I'm
16:18:37 grateful for and start my day that way.
16:18:40 And so, yeah, there's a lot of things.
16:18:45 You know, I read Buddhist...   for a long time,
16:18:49 in my early 20s, I was reading, you know, books
16:18:52 on Buddhism, how to live a meaningful life.  I
16:18:55 really wanted to make sure that as I was
16:18:57 building in community, that I was really
16:19:00 intentional about that.  And so it, you know.
16:19:04 I will say:  I take from every little thing?
16:19:07 Because I really want to live my life with pure
16:19:11 intention.  And ground it in love.  And so
16:19:13 there's things that I will recite.  There's
16:19:15 things that, you know, I will -- you will see
16:19:17 some smoke around me.  I will probably come
16:19:21 around and smudge you.  But it's all really
16:19:23 because I want to build the beloved community
16:19:25 that Dr. King talked about.  And so that really
16:19:27 comes with a lot of forgiveness, as well.  So
16:19:30 not holding so much in your heart, but really
16:19:33 trying to let that go.  And understanding that
16:19:37 all of you have purpose, right?  There's things
16:19:39 that happen to you that you may not have no
16:19:42 control, but how do you channel that pain into
16:19:45 power?  How do you channel your gifts?  How do
16:19:49 you share your gifts with the world?  And so,
16:19:51 you know...   That's kind of the way in which I
16:19:54 try to live my life, is that, you know, when I
16:19:59 have pain, I transform it into...   you know,
16:20:02 gifts that I could share with people like
16:20:05 yourself who are listening today.
16:20:08 GREG CENDANA:  Oo.  Oh, man.  Just take
16:20:10 that in, Carmen.  Thank you, that was so
16:20:11 beautiful.
16:20:14 But thank you, for taking time to be with
16:20:17 UJL today.  I know that for the folks watching
16:20:21 now, and folks who will view the webinar later,
16:20:23 I found a lot of what you said very insightful,
16:20:25 even as someone who's known you for some time
16:20:28 now.  So just continue to be grateful for how
16:20:30 you show up, for your communities, for us, for
16:20:32 all of us.  And so thank you, again, so much
16:20:34 for joining us today.
16:20:35 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  Thank you!  Thank
16:20:39 you, everybody!  Bye!
16:20:42 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Bye, Carmen!  Thank you!
16:20:44 CARMEN PEREZ-JORDAN:  Thank you!
16:20:47 GREG CENDANA:  Awesome.  All right, y'all.
16:20:50 We're almost through with the class.  Some
16:20:52 really powerful speakers today.  Before we
16:20:56 close out, I'm gonna pass it to Kat, who will
16:20:59 help us with some last-minute, last
16:21:02 announcements and what not.  So Kat, pass it to
16:21:02 you!
16:21:04 KAT NASOL:  Awesome.  Thank you so much,
16:21:09 Greg and anise, and Carmen and Soya, and our
16:21:11 accessibility team for really making this a
16:21:14 really powerful first public session.
16:21:17 Some closing announcements, as we all head
16:21:20 off and enjoy the rest of our nights, is that
16:21:22 I'm going to be sharing a few links in the
16:21:26 chat.  The first one is a link for next
16:21:29 Tuesday's public webinar.  And so, that is the
16:21:34 link to sign up for next Tuesday's webinar.
16:21:38 I'm also gonna be sharing a RSVP form for a
16:21:42 webinar of different scholars and activists who
16:21:45 wrote this piece for this article called
16:21:47 Amerasia.  And they also talk about
16:21:49 cross-racial solidarity in Asian American
16:21:51 communities.  I'm also posting that in the
16:21:53 chat, as well.
16:21:58 And lastly, we're also fundraising to help
16:22:00 support our accessibility team, and to help
16:22:03 fund this course.  We are, in many ways, a
16:22:07 grassroots effort.  And so, please also share
16:22:10 this link with your networks, in order to make
16:22:13 sure that this teachings and these courses are
16:22:14 as accessible as possible.
16:22:17 So thank you all so much for attending.
16:22:20 Greg and Kandi, do y'all have any last final
16:22:23 words, as we close out?
16:22:27 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  (Laughs)  We'll see
16:22:28 y'all tomorrow!
16:22:31 KAT NASOL:  See y'all tomorrow!
16:22:33 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  With a new play list
16:22:35 that Greg will drop!  (Laughing)
16:22:37 KAT NASOL:  Yes, awesome.  Thank you so
16:22:39 much, everybody.
16:22:42 Have a good night.
16:23:17 KAT NASOL:  Thanks, everybody!  Thank you
16:23:20 all so much for helping us out!
16:23:22 (audio garbling)
16:23:25 I just wanted to give you all a lot of
16:23:27 love.
16:23:30 Hi, Alex!
16:23:35 I have to personally jump off.  But...
16:23:39 Kandi and Greg just remind me, are you also
16:23:41 having the accessibility teams for tomorrow, as
16:23:44 well?  Or is it mainly going to be breakout
16:23:46 groups?
16:23:51 GREG CENDANA:  Yes, we'll have a captioner
16:23:52 tomorrow.
16:23:55 KAT NASOL:  Okay.  Sounds good.  (Sighs)
16:23:56 GREG CENDANA:  And yeah, Kandi, I think as
16:23:58 the host, I think you're the only one that can
16:24:00 end the meeting.
16:24:01 DJ KUTTIN KANDI:  Oh!  I'm not used to
16:24:04 having that power!  But okay!  (Laughing)
16:24:05 KAT NASOL:  Bye, everyone.
