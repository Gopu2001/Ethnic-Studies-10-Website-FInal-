           <h1>The Fight to End Asian American Racism</h1>
           <br><br>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a webinar hosted by the University of Justice and Liberation, Soya Chung aptly describes the history of Asian American racism: “throughout US history, the central racial narrative has been that in order for some people to prosper, others must necessarily suffer. And that has created suffering for various groups of people across the board. So we need to show that this kind of thinking is a way for people in power to create policies, laws, [and] systems, that hurt all of society” <a href="1.txt">(Soya Chung, 2020)</a>.</p>

           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian American Justice Center Organization put together a list of initiative policies that may allow for more equal treatment of Asian Americans throughout the United States of America, including policies on family immigration, immigration workers, and Muslim and refugee bans. The premise of their policy recommendations is that the dignity of immigrants and their families must be respected, no matter their country of origin, race, religion, gender, or educational attainment. If an end to social injustice is necessary, it is essential for restrictions on Asian immigrants to be lifted and to make societies more homogenized than they are right now <a href="https://advancingjustice-aajc.org/sites/default/files/2019-07/1153_AAJC_Immigration_Final_0.pdf">(AAJC, 2020, page, 72-73)</a>.</p>
