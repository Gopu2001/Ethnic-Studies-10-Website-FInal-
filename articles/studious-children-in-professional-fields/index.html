           <h1>How the Model Minority Myth is Most Commonly Believed</h1>
           <br><br>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image you clicked on featured a studious Asian American girl leaning forward, interested in where she was. She has a calculator in her left hand and phone right beside her. As from what could be ascertained from the image, this girl clearly represents the model minority myth. There are several aspects of the model minority myth, which dictates the stereotype of how Asian American children are naturally well-rounded and extremely talented in every subject, with a “tiger mom” to push them through their educational quest and a father with prestigious positions in STEM industries.</p>
           <br>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every child in the United States of America have had Asian American friends that were extremely talented in class and willing to do whatever it takes to get to the top of the class, with guidance from their motherly figure. As these children grow up, they see their Asian friends go to a prestigious university for continuing their studies and then off to work for the top companies in the world in their preferred industry. Those Asian American friends that do not live like this go unnoticed. Only the prosperous are well educated, recognized for their achievements, and worth maintaining friendships with. These prosperous Asian Americans are what symbolize the model minority myth, while all other Asians are forgotten to the world.</p>

           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Asian American economic growth is depicted here as growing the most, this is what leads many to believe that the model minority myth is true, that if you are an Asian American, you are practically destined for economic success. However, what we do not see is shown in the below table.</p>

           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the National CAPACD, one major change over the past decade debunks the model minority myth. This data reveals how, after the recession ended in 2010, Asian American poverty only climbed. This is the section of Asian Americans that we do not see, but the previous table depicts what we do see.</p>
