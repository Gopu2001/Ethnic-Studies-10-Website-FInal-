           <h1>The Natural Tendency to NOT Help “Intelligent” Asians</h1>
           <br><br>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be common practice for teachers to be ignorant of their Asian students because of the model minority myth. As teachers classified their students as part of the “model minority,” they began to naturally expect them to be at the top of their class. For instance, when Sarah Blackburn, a half-Chinese and half-white student, was receiving low test scores in her precalculus course, her teacher did not expect these kinds of grades from “someone like [her]” <a href="https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/what-is-the-model-minority-myth">(Blackburn, 2019)</a>. Her teacher did expect her to be a part of this model minority stereotype, where she would be at the top of her class and able to go to any college in the nation with her naturally high scores. This notion of Asians being naturally intelligent allows teachers to conclude that they do not need help in their subjects and that they would eventually learn it as the stereotype dictates.</p>
